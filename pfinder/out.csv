this car was built and campaigned by NGT in Miami in 2006-2008 at which time it was sold to a gentleman in Tampa and then sold again to another in Miami. So it has been a Florida car since new.
It has been used strictly as a track day / DE car since 2006 and really only a handful of times since 2008. 
This car has only 13422 miles since new !!!
It is very light and pulls like a freight train. honestly feels like a sport bike on 4 wheels.
some specs:
lightweight flywheel
crank pulley
headers with center out exhaust
ecu flash
full Moton club sport suspension
carbon fiber doors
carbon fiber decklid
carbon fiber spoiler with gurney
lexan side and rear windows
recaro buckets
short shifter
full cage
forgeline wheels
solid engine and transmisson mounts
short 3,4,5 gears
solid toe arm bushings front and rear
all plumbing for cool suit (not included)
all wiring for traqmate (not included)
fresh liqui-moly in engine
fresh motul in transmission
surely this is not everything.
this has been a track car since 2006 and has had several different sets of livery/stickers on it. some paint work also. front and rear bumpers are fiberglass. 
take a look at the pics. i think they pretty much tell the story. 
it has a clean florida title and realistically could be registered for street use. not sure i would go that route but the option is there. 
located in hollywood, fl and inspections are welcomed and encouraged.

I threatened last month when I put my Targa GTS up for sale that my RS might be behind it. Well, today is the day.

I have received LOTS of requests over the years to purchase this beauty, so if the market is still there, she is ready. Car is near flawless, no issues whatsoever. Rev test is perfect, no paint, etc....

If the market is where it was on the last round of offers, she will move to a new owner. The price is $350,000 or more if you guys would like to duke it out 

If the market isnt there, I will hold onto her. She has never been in the rain, never tracked, inside in climate control, the whole shebang

If you are a buyer, please message me. Not looking to negotiate, so I will respond once the messages hit. 

She needs a GREAT home, so let me know

It sits just shy of 38K miles and is under CPO Warranty until 02/19/18.  I looked long and hard for this car and have truly enjoyed the ownership/driving experience.  It's an amazing combination of performance, road manners and reliability.  

It's a truly stunning vehicle.  The photos were taken after a spirited drive on local mountain roads and the car was a bit dusty at the time.  Cleaned up it shines like new.  It has been stored in a climate controlled garage and meticulously maintained and detailed.

No accidents, incidents, paintwork or issues that I am aware of.  The CPO Inspection was performed by RUSNAK Porsche in SoCal on 01/22/16.  The paperwork reflects a total of $3,089 in service and scheduled maintenance (oil and filter, cabin air filter, synchronous belt, spark plugs, trans oil, trans oil for clutch and a brake fluid flush and refill).

I will be happy to facilitate a PPI for serious buyers at either Porsche of Bend, in Central Oregon where the car is located, or a good local German shop.  I will also be available to assist with shipping to the buyer if desired.

Included with the sale are both original keys, all books and manuals and the complete set of ownership/CPO paperwork from PCNA.

The car is highly optioned and the original MSRP was $162,990.  The vehicle was shipped from the factory with the following options:

It sits just shy of 38K miles and is under CPO Warranty until 02/19/18.  I looked long and hard for this car and have truly enjoyed the ownership/driving experience.  It's an amazing combination of performance, road manners and reliability.  

It's a truly stunning vehicle.  The photos were taken after a spirited drive on local mountain roads and the car was a bit dusty at the time.  Cleaned up it shines like new.  It has been stored in a climate controlled garage and meticulously maintained and detailed.

No accidents, incidents, paintwork or issues that I am aware of.  The CPO Inspection was performed by RUSNAK Porsche in SoCal on 01/22/16.  The paperwork reflects a total of $3,089 in service and scheduled maintenance (oil and filter, cabin air filter, synchronous belt, spark plugs, trans oil, trans oil for clutch and a brake fluid flush and refill).

I will be happy to facilitate a PPI for serious buyers at either Porsche of Bend, in Central Oregon where the car is located, or a good local German shop.  I will also be available to assist with shipping to the buyer if desired.

Included with the sale are both original keys, all books and manuals and the complete set of ownership/CPO paperwork from PCNA.

The car is highly optioned and the original MSRP was $162,990.  The vehicle was shipped from the factory with the following options:

Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB)
Porsche DoppelKupplung (PDK)
Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV)

I threatened last month when I put my Targa GTS up for sale that my RS might be behind it. Well, today is the day.

I have received LOTS of requests over the years to purchase this beauty, so if the market is still there, she is ready. Car is near flawless, no issues whatsoever. Rev test is perfect, no paint, etc....

If the market is where it was on the last round of offers, she will move to a new owner. The price is $350,000 or more if you guys would like to duke it out 

If the market isnt there, I will hold onto her. She has never been in the rain, never tracked, inside in climate control, the whole shebang

If you are a buyer, please message me. Not looking to negotiate, so I will respond once the messages hit. 

She needs a GREAT home, so let me know

I am the second owner. I bought the car with under 400 miles. The car had a proper break in and oil changed at 1k miles and 5k miles. The car had a clean DME report when I bought it from Porsche Atlanta Perimeter, and since I have owned it, it has never seen over 6k RPM. The car has zero track miles. There is a small scratch below the P in porsche on the rear of the car (see last image)
Feel free to email or pm me any questions.
Note: I can lower the price if you want to do a pass through transaction through the dealer I am purchasing my next vehicle from.
Price clarification - $99,981 to buy the car outright from me. $97,000 (plus $1395 to the dealer) if we do a pass through transaction.
