WP0AB0949HN473351,Porsche,944,,944,1987,54939,St. Louis,MO ,2018-04-25,12900,Used,Dealership,,Black,Tan,Manual,,1987 Porsche 944,https://www.hemmings.com/classifieds/dealer/porsche/944/1899545.html,,"<p><strong>1987 Porsche 944</strong></p><ul><li><strong>One of 8,346 models exported to the US in 1987</strong></li><li><strong>5L inline four-cylinder</strong></li><li><strong>Five-speed manual transmission</strong></li><li><strong>Four-wheel disc brakes</strong></li><li><strong>Black exterior with tan interior</strong></li><li><strong>Documents include a Hagerty Vehicle Valuation Report, almost $10K in service and maintenance tickets, various small parts and miscellaneous items</strong></li></ul><p>Tired of looking for a classic Porsche and only finding various 911s? MotoeXotica has your answer – this 1987 Porsche 944. Designed to replace the 924, the 944 was slightly faster, better equipped and more refined than the 924; it had better handling, stopping power and was more comfortable to drive. The car had nearly even front-to-rear weight distribution (50.7% F/49.3% R) thanks to the rear transaxle balancing out the engine in the front.</p><p>Dressed in black on the outside, the car's finish is in very good condition, with overall minor blemishes on the fenders and doors visible upon close inspection. Its glass panes are clear but there is a chip on the passenger side of the windshield. The compound curved hatchback glass contains an electric defroster. This Porsche rolls on Sumitomo Touring LST radials, 215/60R15 at all four corners, surrounding Porsche “phone dial” alloy wheels. The car's body panels are straight and solid, the engine bay is tidy and the bumpers are in very good condition.</p><p>For the 944, Porsche re-worked the platform and added a new all-alloy 2.5 L inline-four engine that was, in essence, half of the 928's 5.0L V-8, although very few parts were actually interchangeable. Atypical in luxury sports cars, the four-cylinder engine was chosen for fuel efficiency and size, because it had to be fitted from below on the Neckarsulm, West Germany production line. To overcome roughness caused by the unbalanced secondary forces that are typical of four-cylinder engines, Porsche included two counter-rotating balance shafts running at twice engine speed. Invented in 1904 by British engineer Frederick Lanchester, and further developed and patented in 1975 by Mitsubishi Motors, balance shafts carry eccentric weights which produce inertial forces that balance out the unbalanced secondary forces, making a four-cylinder engine feel as smooth as a six-cylinder. Revised bodywork with wider wheel arches, similar to that of the 924 Carrera GT, a fresh interior and upgrades to the braking and suspension systems rounded out the major changes.</p><p>Inside, the tan bucket seats are in great shape and the matching carpet is in good condition. The black headliner is in similar good order save for wear at the base of both A-pillars, the two-tone instrument panel, black upper and tan lower is also in good order. All of the interior lighting, instruments, dome and cargo, were converted to LEDs in 2013. The factory four-spoke steering wheel is present and in good shape. Except for a blemish on the driver's side window crank, the door panels, mirrors, center console and shift lever are all in a similar state to the carpet and headliner. The cargo bay is in very good order except for the worn carpet at the hatch lid. Rounding out the interior is an Alpine AM/FM stereo.</p><p>In January 2007, the previous owner replaced the engine timing belt, timing belt tensioner, balance shaft belt, balance shaft tensioner, power steering and air conditioning belts. In April 2007, he replaced a pressure sensor, the fuel regulator, four spark plugs and the shifter handle. In May 2007, he replaced the clutch assembly, a fuel pressure dampener, various seals and other hardware. In November 2007, he ordered a standard rotor kit and Mahle oil filter and washer. He also had the front inner wheel seals replaced that month.</p><p>In January 2008, he had the front brakes rebuilt and replaced the sway bar bushings. He had new tires installed and balanced that same month. In February 2008, he had two tie rod ends replaced, a tune-up and a throttle response cam replaced. In March 2008, he had a new distributor cap installed, plus new spark plugs and wires. In April 2008, he had the cooling system pressure tested after a leak that stemmed from a previous accident. A new radiator was installed, a core support repaired and system again pressure tested to verify no leakage. In July 2008, he bought a new radiator fan, blower motor relay and oil filter. He had the fan motor replaced, along with its thermostatic switch. That month, he also ordered new lower control arms and a hatchback lock cylinder. He then had an outer tie rod end replaced and the control arms installed. In September 2008, he had a new radiator expansion tank fitted with new cap, replaced the clutch and brake pedal pads, replaced an upper radiator hose and other parts.</p><p>In April 2009, he ordered a new idle speed/air control valve, a new set of spark plugs, an oil filter and an intake manifold gasket. In May 2009, he ordered a throttle position sensor. He also ordered a fuel injector seal kit, an oil pressure switch and sending unit, a throttle body gasket, throttle body base and O-ring, a rubber mount, two hoses, a vacuum hose kit and a fuel cap that month.</p><p>In May 2012, he ordered gear oil, synthetic motor oil, an oil filter, a spark plug and regular motor oil. In August 2012, he ordered two control arm bushing assemblies, rebuilt lower control arms and there were two core charges.</p><p>In August 2013, he ordered a tie rod assembly, an A/C slider knob, a rear wiper cap, a complete LED instrument light kit, various LED bulbs and other assorted parts. Finally, he ordered a new set of Sumitomo tires for the car.</p><p>In mid-1985, the 944 underwent its first significant changes. These included a new dash and door panels, embedded radio antenna, upgraded alternator (from 90 to 115 amp), increased oil sump capacity, new front and rear cast alloy control arms and semi-trailing arms, larger fuel tank, optional heated and powered seats, Porsche Hi-Fi sound system and revisions in the mounting of the transaxle to reduce noise and vibration. The “cookie cutter” style wheels used in the early 944s were upgraded to new “phone dial” style wheels (Fuchs wheels remained an option).</p><p>More than 163,000 944s were produced, making it the most successful car line in Porsche history until the introductions of the Boxster and 997 Carrera.</p><p>Car includes documents include a Hagerty Vehicle Valuation Report, almost $10K in service and maintenance tickets, various small parts and miscellaneous items.</p><p>Competition to this 944 in 1987 included Lotus' Turbo Esprit, Chevrolet's Corvette, Maserati's Biturbo, Audi's Quattro, Nissan's 300ZX Turbo and BMW's M3.</p><p>This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Current mileage on the odometer shows 54,939 miles. It is sold as is, where is, on a clean and clear, mileage exempt title.

A new 16-valve head was designed with different valve timing and centrally located spark plugs allowing greater torque.  For mid year 86', larger bembo brakes were also fitted to increase stopping performance. These cars are referred to as 1986.5 model years and are the last of the original styled body before the redesign in 1987 of the 928S4.  The 928S was the flagship performance GT car of its day and still holds its own in modern company.  </p><p><strong>The desirable 5-Speed manual gearbox 928S on offer here is a truly unique and very original example, finished in stunning Iris Blue Metallic over an extremely rare Pearl White and Ocean Blue full leather cabin.

Powered by a 3.8L 6-cylinder engine producing 355hp and backed by a Tiptronic S Automatic transmission. Everyday driveability is attainable with the Tiptronic S transmission and it allows for quick shifts and acceleration. Drop the top and enjoy.Though the cabin has a function-oriented layout, upscale materials on the doors and dashboard, and remarkable craftsmanship and attention to detail throughout welcomes both driver and passenger. The cockpit of this Porsche maintains basic design themes from the past but boasts cleaner layouts and enhanced functionality, particularly the classic instrument cluster. The black leather seats in front are firmly bolstered and deeply contoured, and are in excellent condition and, partnered with the perfectly arranged and precisely weighted pedals, offer miles of comfortable driving.Nearly devoid of extraneous trim, this 2006 Porsche 911 Carrera S Cabriolet looks the part of a serious performance machine. Porsche notes that low, smooth-bodied 911 Carrera models have a wider track and a slimmer, more accentuated waistline. This incarnation of Porsche's rear-engined sports machine overlays the familiar, fluid 911 lines with a bit of retrogressive styling. Porsche reinforced the look that was spawned back in 1964 while expanding the already formidable capabilities of the platform that it replaced.This car impresses with its refined styling and athletic handling, with strong road grip and minimal body lean. The Carrera's acceleration is particularly impressive -- a result of its direct-injected 3.8L 6-cylinder engine that's paired with Porsche's quick and smooth 6-speed Tiptronic transmission. The power-steering system is very responsive and precise, and the large front brakes are shared with the 911. The Carrera S especially shines when you drive it quickly around corners. It's tremendously well-balanced and out-handles virtually every other sports car.For more information on this outstanding 2006 Porsche 911 Carrera S Cabriolet or any of our other 40+ Porsches always in stock, contact one of our friendly and knowledgeable sales consultants or always feel free to drop by our Bellevue, WA showrooms and peruse the West Coast's finest assortment of luxury, exotic, special interest and collectible cars - We Always Have 200+ on Site at our 5-acre Park Place Center.

During the restoration, this 356 was completely disassembled so that every aspect could be properly addressed. The 356 was stripped down to the bare shell and it had minimal rust. The body and panels are original and still retain their correct stampings/numbers. All panels were pre-fit with bumpers, overrider bars, windshield frame and soft top to ensure the absolute best result. The complete driveline was rebuilt, engine, transmission, suspension, braking system, wire harness, and fuel system. All the chrome is triple plated, all the components were restored or replaced. No color was listed on the Certificate of Authenticity or Kardex so the car was painted in a beautifully original color of Aqua Marine Blue with Red interior. Absolutely superb in every way, this 356A Speedster is ready for immediate road or concours use. Complete with tools, books, side curtains, boot cover and Kardex &amp; photo documentation of the restoration. Truly one of the best 1958 Speedsters that you will find with no issues.</p> <p>60 horsepower, 1,582cc OHV air-cooled horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine with dual Zenith carburetors, four-speed manual 644 transmission, independent front suspension with laminated torsion bars, parallel trailing arms, and tubular shock absorbers, independent rear swing axles with torsion bars and tubular shock absorbers, and four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes. Wheelbase: 82.7 in.</p> <p>Porsche has the Speedster to thank for their success in the United States. Without this little convertible, it could be argued that Porsche sales might not have ever taken off in the fiercely competitive U.S. market. The car's low-slung and focused looks appealed to sports car enthusiasts and its price of just under $3,000 definitely helped to get Speedsters off the showroom floors and out onto the open road. Boasting few creature comforts but excellent driving characteristics, it helped cement Porsche's reputation in the United States and earned it a hugely desirable portion of the sports car market at a time when the motto of most British marques was ''export or die.''</p> <p>The Speedster holds a special place in Porsche history, not only as a sales success but also as an icon of minimalist automotive design. It remains a beloved vehicle today, and a well-restored and properly maintained Speedster, such as this example, is on the wish list of nearly every car enthusiast the world over. This status has also contributed to a meteoric rise in desirability for these cars, as they lead the charge for all 356s and 911s that are gaining momentum in the marketplace. Simply put, no important collection would be complete without a proper Speedster, as it is an equal in automotive design and history as the California Spider and 300 SL, but it further benefits from practicality and ease of use, which makes it as perfect for running errands as handling twisty mountain roads. Motoring enthusiasts new to the classic car world are well served to acquire a ''blue chip'' Porsche such as this.</p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Construction of the first cars began in 1948 in Gmund, Austria before relocating to Germany and production ran all the way to April of 1965. Over this time, the 356 models saw evolutionary revisions and upgrades in both comfort and performance.</p><p>As Porsche was gearing up 911 series production, they pulled out all the stops for the outgoing 356 model.  In addition to the “C” series updates; notably disc brakes all around - the “SC” specification provided the most powerful (outside of four-cam Carrera race engines) pushrod 4-cylinder motor to date for the 356 line, producing 95hp. The 356 SC provided high levels of performance in 1965, and remains a treat to drive today.</p><p>The car here was sold new by Competition Motors in Culver City, CA to Mr. Vahe Keshishia on November 26, 1964. This 356 has been a West Coast car all of its life per the understood history. The car was owned by Thomas and Bobbie Adams in Portland, Oregon for many years until 1999 when acquired by the current owner after a multi-year search. Most recently, the car has had single family ownership in Washington State for almost 20 years, with careful summer time use and maintenance. The 110K miles showing on the odometer are believed to be correct.</p><p>This 356 SC benefits from an older high-end driver restoration approximately 20 years ago. During this process, the car was painted Signal Red (originally the car was Light Ivory) – a correct 1965 color. The body panels are all very straight with decent gaps throughout, and only a handful of minor blemishes. The trim and rubber are all clean and highly presentable while all lenses are free from cracks or major flaws, and all glass is original, including the Sigla windshield. A Carrera look muffler skirt was added during the restoration as well. Although the records are not present for this restoration work that predates current ownership, one can see it was done to a high standard for the era, and has aged well.</p><p>The engine, drivetrain, braking system, and suspension appear to have been all rebuilt during the restoration process. The engine starts easily cold or warm, and emits no smoke. The engine pulls smoothly through the rev range, with no hesitation, or hiccups – the Solex carbs have been fully rebuilt as well (removed for photographs are modern air filters for regular use if desired).</p><p>The interior was fully refurbished and all new weather-stripping, felt seals, window channels, etc. were fitted during the restoration. Square weave carpets are crisp, door panels and door hardware are in excellent condition, gauges are clean and in full working condition. The sunroof works smoothly with the electric switch, and the headliner condition is good. The painted dash is in excellent condition, and brings a smile when you slide into the driver's seat.</p><p>The front trunk area is tidy with the plastic liner in great condition, with a date coded (8/63) spare wheel/tire, the original jack, and toolkit all present. A newer battery (6V) was recently fitted during recent maintenance per records.</p><p>Driving this car is a treat – it is fully sorted and ready for weekend touring. The 4 speed manual transmission shifts smoothly and precisely, and the brakes engage with purpose and stop the car with no pulling. It sits on Porsche steel 15” wheels (widened to 5.5” all around, with date codes from 1965-1970) in chrome finish with brand new Vredestein Sprint Classic 185/70R15 tires.</p><p>Showing 110K miles on the odometer, this numbers matching, sunroof equipped, 1965 Porsche 356 SC is offered with factory jack, spare wheel/tire, owner's manual, original tool kit, records back to 2004, plus Porsche COA and Kardex.</p><p>Please call Jason at 206-355-7727 for more information on this 1965 Porsche 356 SC for sale.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$135,000 firm               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Comparisons with the 959 - Porsche's technical tour de force the previous decade - were inevitable. Still considered among the most powerful and sophisticated models Porsche has ever offered.Delivered new to Roger Jobs Porsche in Bellingham, WA, this particular Turbo S was purchased new by its only owner and has been a Seattle area car from new. In addition to the plethora of standard equipment found on a Turbo S, this car was ordered with options that include; the aforementioned Cobalt Blue Metallic paint, full-leather in Metropolitan Blue, racing-style sport seats, carbon and leather steering wheel, colored seat stitching, digital sound package, 18 factory-painted alloy wheels, remote CD changer, leather tray behind parking brake, Porsche floor mats in Metropolitan Blue.

Additionally featuring carbon fiber dash insets, instrument surrounds, and door-panel inserts, carbon and aluminum shifter and hand-brake handles.This 993 has been carefully preserved, garaged and maintained by one fastidious owner from new and its brilliant current condition reflects the consideration put forth over the years. Importantly, this 993 is accompanied by its original Window Sticker, all books in sleeve - including data cards pamphlets and vouchers, both sets of keys, tools in roll, unused air compressor and spare assembly, and Porsche Certificate of Authenticity.When you see a 993 Turbo S you are taken by its striking beauty and when you drive one you become addicted to its incredibly powerful and nimble feel.

In 1951, 1300 and 1500 cc engines with considerably more power were introduced. By late 1952 the divided windscreen was gone, replaced by a V-shaped unit which fit into the same opening. In 1953, the 1300 S or ""Super"" was introduced, and the 1100 cc engine was dropped. In late 1954 Max Hoffman, the sole US importer of Porsches, convinced Porsche to build a stripped down roadster version with minimal equipment and a cut-down windscreen. Towards the end of the original 356's time (in 1955, when the 356A was about to be introduced) Hoffman, wanting a model name rather than just a number got the factory to use the name ""Continental"" which was applied mostly to cars sold in the United States. Ford, makers of the Lincoln Continental, sued.[8] This name was used only in 1955 and today this one year version is especially valued. For 1956, the equivalent version was briefly sold as the ""European"".[8] Today all of the earliest Porsches are highly coveted by collectors and enthusiasts worldwide based on their design, reliability and sporting performance.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><br><span style=""font-size:20px;""><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></span>:</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><span style=""font-size:20px;"">THE EXTERIOR IS FLAWLESS ON THIS PORSCHE.

It is the correct kind of engine for this vehicle, built late in the production run of model 528engines which were produced between September 1952 until November 1954. This engine serial number P40954, was produced late in 1954 because the very last model 528 engine was P40999.Therefore this engine is the 45th from the last model 528 engine built late in 1954, and is period correct for this car, being produced by the factory a few units later than the original engine that came with the car. All Porsche 356 15005 cars used the model 528 engine which utilized roller bearings for the connecting rod mains. It was the last of the two—piece magnesium engine casings, before they were replaced with the three piece aluminum alloy casings. The engine case halves are factory—matching magnesium halves, both stamped with number 187.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><span style=""font-size:20px;"">This engine has been rebuilt with as follows:</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><span style=""font-size:20px;"">The roller bearing crankshaft has been replaced with a modern crankshaft for improved durability and better suitability for street driving. The original roller bearing crankshaft with its connecting rods still attached, goes with the car. The casings have been machined, with align boring of both crankshaft and camshaft, with new main bearings fabricated to factory specifications. The camshaft has had the journals ground and chromed to factory specifications. The connecting rods have been replaced with units having modern big end shell bearing and small end bushings. All tappet bores are to factory specifications. The engine has new pistons, and all internal components have been replaced or rebuilt. The carburetors have been rebuilt and are jetted for Colorado's elevation.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><span style=""font-size:20px;"">This engine has been built to produce the original factory output of 80 horsepower. The entire engine has been gone through by High Mountain Classics, a restoration shop with a great reputation and numerous concourse awards including dozens of Pebble Beach trophies. The engine was broken in on an engine dyno, and factory correct output has been confirmed.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; ""> </p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><span style=""font-size:20px;""><strong>DISCLOSURE</strong>:</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><span style=""font-size:20px;"">YOU WILL SEE IN THE INTERIOR DASH PHOTOS THAT THE OIL TEMP GAUGE IS MISSING.

The 911 Turbo is an exciting mixture of power and control. Powered by a racecar-derived 3.6L 415hp/415lb-ft of torque 6-Cylinder engine with a smooth shifting 5-speed Tiptronic transmission, the twin-turbo six-cylinder engine gives the Porsche 911 Turbo staggering performance capabilities. Control comes from all-wheel drive, and the revered Porsche Stability Management system (PSM). Original MSRP was $124,845 with a nice list of factory options, including; the previously noted Midnight Blue Metallic paint color along with the aforementioned Supple Leather Seats in Natural Brown, Stainless Steel Exhaust Pipes, Porsche Crests in Headrests, Aluminum Shifter, Aluminum e-Brake. This sensational 911 also features a Gemballa Body kit, adding unique styling and flair to an already impressive design, along with upgraded Champion RS81 Wheels. It has been a Florida car since new and is in outstanding condition throughout.The cockpit of this Porsche maintains basic design themes from the past but boasts cleaner layouts and enhanced functionality, particularly the classic instrument cluster. Though the cabin has a function-oriented layout, upscale materials on the doors and dashboard, and remarkable craftsmanship and attention to detail throughout welcomes both driver and passenger. The natural brown leather seats in front are firmly bolstered and deeply contoured, and are in excellent condition, and partnered with the perfectly arranged and precisely weighted pedals, offer miles of comfortable driving.As would be expected from Porsche, long known for its unique sports car engineering, the Turbo came in with cutting-edge performance technology. Porsche fitted them with dynamic suspension technology capable of handling high-speed cornering. Engine and transmission employed the latest technology to deliver incredible acceleration while keeping fuel economy reasonable. This car impresses with its refined styling and athletic handling, with strong road grip and minimal body lean. The Turbo's acceleration is particularly impressive -- a result of its twin-turbocharged 3.6L flat-six and paired with Porsche's outstanding 5-speed Tiptronic transmission -- The steering is very responsive and precise, and the race-bred Porsche brakes are able to quickly diminish high rates of speed.For more information on this 2003 Porsche 911 Turbo Coupe, or any of our 40+ Porsches always in stock, please contact our friendly and knowledgeable sales team, or always feel free to stop by our Bellevue, WA Park Place Ltd campus - Where we have over 40,000 sq ft of indoor showrooms filled with the finest cars.

This is the heaviest optioned short wheelbase 911 we have ever seen with the original bill of sale to back it up! The documentation from new, the options including A/C is incredible and the condition is stunning for a virtually unrestored car. Paul's brother later lamented ''I saw Paul's Porsche once, before I moved from California. His love for that vehicle could only be compared to the love he had for his wife.'' Paul's care for the care is unbelievably well documented. He never worked on the car himself but only the most trusted of mechanics got the job. The 911 was serviced at Polak's shop from the day it was new until late 1974. That was when a few of Vasek's most talented mechanics left him to open their own shop, something called Andial!<br> In 1975 Paul's 911 had accumulated 95,000 miles and the original paint was no longer up to his very particular standards. He went to one of Southern California's best painters, Big Al Martinez. Al painted so many Porsche's he printed up a brochure explaining what was involved and the difference between lacquer and enamel, as well as custom touches available in 1975.  The bare metal re-paint came out to almost $3,000, a huge sum back in 1975. The condition of that paint today is the true testament to its quality. I could continue with a few more decades of history on this 911 but this car really needs to be seen to be believed. This is the best documented early 911 we've seen.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$245,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

By 1979 the factory began to switch its efforts to the new 936, 956, and 962 prototype, non-production based racing cars. This change spelt the end for the factory Porsche 935.</p> <p>However, a demand still existed for the continued development of the ferocious 935. Fortunately some years earlier Porsche had given its blessing to a number of racing teams with close ties to the factory to purchase components and drivetrains, and then designed and produced their own upgraded chassis and bodywork. While these newly constructed vehicles were still generally referred to as Porsche 935s, in reality, they were entirely new designs that advanced the 935 concept to a new level of speed and sophistication. The pinnacle of these independent efforts was the overall win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979 by the Kremer 935 K3, the last production based car ever to win overall at Le Mans.</p> <p>The Kremer Brothers of Cologne, Germany had enjoyed a close relationship with the factory since 1970, and were allowed to proceed independently with further development of many models of racing Porsches. They built their first variant of the 935, the K1, in 1976. By 1981, Kremer was ready to produce its fourth version of the Porsche 935, the K4, inspired by the factory Moby Dick 935 produced by Porsche in 1978. In fact, the factory gave the Kremer's the drawings, parts, and the Moby Dick car itself on commission to build the new K4.</p> <p>01 is the first of only two K4s produced, and as a result of Kremer's constant development, bore little resemblance to an early factory 935. The K4 had evolved into a totally different vehicle, built on a full tubular chassis, with only a roof and windshield being supplied by the Porsche factory. 01 was fielded by Kremer Racing in Europe during the 1981 season, and was driven by Bob Wollek to TWO WINS and a total of six podium finishes.</p> <p>John Fitzpatrick bought the car from Kremer for the 1982 IMSA season, and his team of Glen Blakely and Max Crawford immediately set to work on upgrading and modifying the car. They built a completely new body with in-door air ducts for the intercoolers, and also designed a new rear suspension and belly pans. Mechanically the K4 continued to develop the tried-and-true 935 turbo motor by using enhanced air-to-air intercoolers and ducting resulting in a 50 horsepower advantage over other 935s. With the boost fully turned up the car was capable of producing well over 800 horsepower. The result of all of this work was FIVE WINS and only one DNF in 1982. In 1983 the car raced only twice, with another win at Riverside. In 1984 the K4 was rented to Al Holbert for three races, which saw the switch to Holbert's #14 and Lowenbrau livery.</p> <p>In 1986 the K4 moved into private hands when Fitzpatrick sold it to Mike Hagen of Los Angeles, CA. It passed through a few owners over the years including actor Nicolas Cage from 1999 to 2002, and most recently Touring Auto Maintenance. During their ownership the car was taken care of by Amalfi Racing, and there are extensive maintenance records and race setup notes that come with the car.</p> <p>Since arriving at Canepa the K4 has received a thorough mechanical inspection along with over 150 hours of concours detail work. With drivers such as Bob Wollek, John Fitzpatrick, David Hobbs, Derek Bell, Al Holbert and Preston Henn, this Kremer K4 represents the end of one of the greatest eras of GT racing. Here is a unique opportunity to own and drive the last in a line of stunningly successful Kremer 935 race cars.</p> <p>'The K4 was a sensational car, the fastest 935 ever, and still is.' - John Fitzpatrick</p> <p>Most recently the K4 has been featured in the August/September 2016 issue of Classic Porsche magazine.</p> Specifications:<br> <p>Engine:<br> 700hp @7500rpm<br> 536 ft/lbs @ 6100rpm<br> 3,162 cc twin-twin turbo flat six with an aluminum block and head, dry sump lubrication, dual ignition, Kugelfisher fuel injection, Carillo connecting rods, Mahle forged pistons.<br> Transaxle: Porsche G30 four-speed synchromesh, with spool differential<br> Weight: 2,229 lbs, with a 39% front / 61% rear split<br> Top speed: 220 mph when fitted with the Le Mans gearing</p> Ownership History:<br> <p>Early 1981:      Built, owned, and raced by Kremer Racing, Cologne, Germany<br> Late 1981:       Sold by Kremer to John Fitzpatrick, San Diego, CA<br> 1986:               Sold to Mike Hagen, Los Angeles, CA<br> 1989:               Sold to Brian De Vries, CA<br> 1996:               Sold to Leon Desimone, Irvine, CA<br> 1999:               Sold to Nicolas Cage, Los Angeles, CA<br> 2002:               Sold to A.

It was one of the wildest Porsche 935s of the post-factory era, and also one of the fastest.</p> <p>From 1977 the Porsche 935 was the car to have if you wanted to win IMSA or world championship events, but by 1982 it became very clear that a standard 935 was no longer competitive. The Porsche factory built its last 935 in 1979, so it was left to private teams to develop the cars with more aggressive aerodynamics and chassis designs.</p> <p>Bob Akin knew if he wanted to win, he would have to come up with something totally radical for the 1982 season. Akin commissioned Chuck Gaa of Gaaco to design and build a ''Super GTP 935''. To improve aerodynamics and increase the straight-line speed of the new car a Lola T600 GTP nose was used. A new purpose built monocoque bonded aluminum chassis was constructed combining the best of the new GTP technology with the proven power and reliability of the Porsche 935 mechanicals.</p> <p>According to the rules, the windshield and roof section of a standard Porsche 930 still had to be used. To improve airflow even further the entire roof structure was tilted to put the windshield at a better angle.</p> <p>Due to its complexity and unique design, the car was delivered late after the season had already begun. It made its first appearance at Lime Rock in May, which served as a test for Le Mans. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June the car's design came into its own and showed tremendous straight-line speed down the famous Mulsanne Straight. Unfortunately Akin and co-drivers David Cowart and Kemper Miller only lasted two hours before a malfunction with the reserve gas tank sidelined the car.</p> <p>After Le Mans the car returned to the United States to compete in the remainder of the 1982 IMSA season. After much testing and development the car finished fourth at Mid-Ohio with Akin and Hurley Haywood driving, and seventh at Road Atlanta with Akin and Derek Bell. The car's final appearance would be at the Pocono 500.</p> <p>The car sat in Akins shop until 1999 when Jacques Rivard purchased the car and performed a complete restoration, bringing the car back to better than new condition. All suspension components were crack checked, and new components were used where needed. G&amp;S Autoworks completely rebuilt the engine and transmission. It now is one of the most potent 935s in vintage racing.</p> <p>Canepa completed a full inspection and detail on the car. It is in spectacular condition and is eligible to compete in historics worldwide, including the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion.</p> Race History<br> <p>5/31/82            Coca-Cola 400 Lime Rock       23rd     Bob Akin                     #5<br> 6/20/82            24 Hours of Le Mans               DNF     Akin, Cowart, Miller     #76<br> 8/22/82            Road America 500 miles         33rd     Akin, Bell                     #5<br> 9/5/82              Mid-Ohio 6 Hours                    4th       Akin, Haywood            #5<br> 9/12/82            Road Atlanta   500 km             7th       Akin, Bell                     #5<br> 9/26/82            Pocono 500 miles                    39th     Akin, Bell                     #5</p> Specifications<br> <p>Engine size: 3.2 liter?<br> Power rating: 800+ horsepower<br> Body material: Bonded Aluminum Monocoque with Fiberglass Body   <br> Weight: 2324 lbs<br> Suspension: coil-over MacPherson strut - front, coil-over trailing arm - rear<br> Tires: 23.5 x 10.5 - 16 front, 27 x 14 - 16 rear<br> Dimensions: 78'' wide, 190.5'' long</p> About Bob Akin<br> <p>Akin began his racing career in 1957, competing in outboard boat racing and in drag racing in 1957 and 1958. He switched to road racing, acquiring his amateur SCCA national racing license in 1959 and hired legendary sports car racer John Fitch as his driving coach. Proving a quick study, he piloted an Alfa Veloce Spyder to his first win in only his third race at Bridgehampton. He drove a front engine Volpini Formula Junior in 1960, then switched to a 1957 Ferrari 500 TRC for several races during the early part of the 1961 season, before retiring in July of that year, to concentrate on the family business.</p> <p>Almost by accident, Akin returned to racing in 1973, after accepting an invitation from his friend, Sam Posey, to drive a few laps in his Mercedes-Benz 300SL, at the July 4th, 1973 Vintage Sports Car Club of America event at Lime Rock Park. Within a month, he was back at it in earnest, driving a Lotus 11 in vintage racing events until switching to the 1959 Cooper-Monaco that would prove to be his favorite racer, in 1975.</p> <p>In 1978, he purchased a Porsche RSR Carrera thinking it would be fun to run in the 1978 12 Hours of Sebring. They ran what was considered to be a test run at Daytona, before the Sebring event, then continued on racing a full season that would include racing at Le Mans with a Porsche 935 Turbo. Now solidly back in the drivers seat, compiled an impressive list of achievements, highlighted by a 6-Hour win at Watkins Glen, '79 and '86 12 Hours of Sebring victories, two second-place finishes in the '81 and '82 24 Hours of Daytona, six appearances, including a fourth overall in '84, at Le Mans. He won the IMSA Camel GT series in 1986 and had four top-10 finishes in IMSA Endurance Championship points standings. He was also a member and former president of the prestigious Road Racing Drivers Club.</p> <p>Akin retired from professional racing in 1991 but stayed quite active in the sport. He returned to racing his beloved vintage and historic cars, competed in the Fastmasters racing series, wrote articles for Road &amp; Track magazine, and did on-air commentary for Speedvision, TBS and ESPN television. Following his retirement from Hudson Wire Company, in 1995, Akin also devoted his time to the management of Bob Akin Motorsports (Now Hudson Historics), which specializes in the restoration and race preparation of historic race cars.<br> On April 25, 2002, he was gravely injured in a violent crash while testing a powerful 1988 Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo for the Walter Mitty Challenge for historic cars at Road Atlanta. He was airlifted to Grady Memorial Hospital after the accident. After briefly rallying, the 66 year old succumbed due to complications from his injuries on April 29.</p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

The star of the show was the jewel of an engine that resided in the back of the car: a two-liter, four-cam masterpiece that put out 130 horsepower.</p> <p>This example has been meticulously mechanically and cosmetically restored by Road Scholars in North Carolina. They took 120351 down to its bare shell and painted it in its factory correct slate grey. Autobahn Interiors took the Carrera's original interior and recovered its correct hue in red leather. The engine was rebuilt by four-cam expert, Chris Powell, of Chris's German Auto Service. While not original to the car, the Type 587/1 engine is correct to a 1963 Carrera 2.</p> <p>All the original components on car were completely restored before being reinstalled. Every system was gone through and examined for functionally and correct appearance. Completed in 2008, the car would go on to win the Zuffenhausen Award (296.2 points out of 300) at the 2009 Porsche Parade.</p> <p>Here is an excellent opportunity to own a mechanically and cosmetically correct example of the rare two-liter, four-cam Carrera 2 - the most advanced 356 ever built.</p> <p>About the Carrera 2</p> <p>Introduced in the autumn of 1961 at the Frankfurt Auto Show, the 2-liter Carrera II became the first Porsche production car to have disc brakes. Numerous additional cooling vents were among the recently introduced improvements, but most attention was focused on the new 1,966cc four-cam engine. This produced 130bhp (DIN) at 6,200rpm, and while the Carrera's top speed increased only slightly to around 125mph, there was a marked improvement in acceleration despite the newcomer's greater weight, the 0-100mph time being cut from 33.5 seconds to 27.2. The Carrera II had been introduced part way through 356B production, and continued virtually unchanged after the 356C's arrival in 1963.</p> <p>The Fuhrmann-designed Carrera 4-cam engine, Type 587/1, with 130 hp, was very complex, and it took an experienced factory mechanic using brand new parts nearly 100 hours to assemble. This was an expensive venture for any car company, let alone one as small as Porsche. The 356B Carrera 2 Cabriolet cost around $8,000, almost twice the cost of a similar pushrod-engined Cabriolet, by far the most expensive road car Porsche had ever produced, and probably the most costly to build. As a comparison, a new Cadillac Eldorado convertible cost just over $6,000. Obviously, this was a hard car to sell at those numbers, which accounts for its scarcity and exclusivity today.</p> <p>'The car's acceleration is truly exhilarating,' enthused Road &amp; Track magazine. 'The clutch takes quite a bit of throttle without protest, and when one finds that it is time for 2nd gear, down comes the stick in a flick, more acceleration, and other cars pass as in reverse.

,Porsche,930,,930 Turbo,1979,103341,Emeryville,CA ,2018-04-25,82500,Used,Dealership,,Salmon Metallic,Black Leather,,,1979 Porsche 930 Turbo,https://www.hemmings.com/classifieds/dealer/porsche/930/1875137.html,,"<p>1979 Porsche 930 Turbo<br>s/n 9309800323  engine no. 6891118<br>Salmon Metallic with Black Leather Interior<br> <br>Although the Porsche Turbo is now a natural fixture in the consciousness of car buffs because it is such an iconic car  it was genuinely earth-shattering when it emerged in the mid 1970s. After massive success pioneering the use of turbochargers during the first half of the 1970s in the 917 Can Am and 911-based sports cars  Porsche had the knowhow to bring a reliable and capable turbocharged road car to market. The 930 was hugely impressive when new  and contemporary road testers gushed about its effortless ability to gain speed with deceptive composure  an attribute that seemed positively alien in a period when few drivers had experienced turbocharged cars. And indeed the car's massive performance by contemporary standards made it a genuine contender for supercar status  placing Porsche in a different category than it had previously occupied in the eyes of performance car junkies for the first time. <br><br>In many ways  the production 930 was diametrically opposed to Porsche's previous high performance 911  the Carrera RS. Where the RS of just a few years earlier was a raw and elemental homologated race car adapted for the road  the 930 was a proper flagship: a luxurious and refined car meant to effortlessly cover great distance at high speed. However  during this period  competition prepared Porsche Turbos were cleaning up on the race track  and the 930's lurid fender flares and rear spoiler gave the car a distinctive  purposeful  and aggressive presence that would be immortalized  among other places  on the walls of many schoolboys. Although relatively affordable and overlooked by collectors for many years  early 930s have emerged as collectible cars thanks to their iconic styling  innovative technology  and direct connection to some of Porsche's most successful race cars  which by extension  means some of the most successful race cars of all time.<br><br>Initially available in a non-intercooled 3.0 liter variant that is now highly collectible  albeit curious to drive  a 3.3 liter intercooled variant superseded the 3.0 for the 1978 model year. By 1980  US laws had evolved enough to prevent the further sale of the 930 by Porsche North America  and it was not until 1986 when the incorporation of oxygen sensor  electronic assistance for the mechanical fuel injection system  and three-way catalytic converter permitted its return to the US. Thus  the 1979 model year 930 is  especially in the United States  a special year.<br> <br>This particular car was manufactured in December of 1978 and sold new on the 7th of March 1979 to a resident of Ventura  California by Masterson Porsche-Audi  also in Ventura. Originally finished in the color combination it still wears today: salmon metallic with black leather Interior. It has been repainted but retains its original interior  books set  tools  and blue California license plate dating back to 1981  indicating that the car has spent nearly its entire life in California. The license plate indicates that the car was last registered in California in 2013. Accordingly  the car is structurally excellent. <br> <br>The car also has its original  matching-numbers engine. The service book stamps indicate that the car was driven sparingly in its early life: just 6 000 miles in 6 years  but it was driven more regularly in later years: it now shows 103 000 miles. The car is pleasingly undisturbed  always a desirable trait in a 930 because so many of these cars were modified. It has its original intercooler  exhaust system  and steering wheel  and aside from a Momo shift knob  stereo system  and period alarm  the car has not been modified.<br> <br>The car was repainted some years ago and is presentable with good gloss  but close inspection reveals numerous flaws: some chips from road use and some surface blemishes such as tape lines around the fender guards and blend lines on the A-pillars. The body is straight with good panel fit and operation  and the trim is in good shape. The glass  lights  and lenses are in good shape  with minor wear and a few hairline cracks in the rear lenses  which are European market lenses. The windscreen is a Sigla item and is likely original  with some road road wear.  The car has H4 headlamps which are in excellent shape. The car sits on 7” and 8” by 16” fuchs which were chromed and are generally nice but there is some minor pitting to the finish.<br> <br>The interior appears to be original and is excellent considering this. There is light wear on the driver's seat bolster  but far less than would be expected given the mileage. The leather is impressively supple throughout. The leather on top of the dash shows some minor shrinkage and drying and the door panels are in good shape  with some aging. The carpets are in very good condition and the switchgear is original and in fine shape aside from missing center console knobs for the AC. One of the vent inserts in the dashboard is missing as well.<br> <br>The engine compartment is stock and clean  but not detailed or restored in any way. The AC system and original intercooler are present. The struts for both the front and rear deck lids are effective and have likely been replaced recently. The trunk carpet is intact and in good shape  and the structural components visible when it is removed are also in good  undisturbed shape. The original spare and tool roll are present.<br> <br>The car is very exciting to drive. The car idles perfectly when cold but hunts a bit when warm  but otherwise runs superbly. It is an evocative driving experience and seems to pull more strongly than most 930s. It boosts cleanly and is generally a very well-behaved engine. The typical 930 pops and crackles are audible through the exhaust on trailing throttle. The clutch grabs positively and the gear linkage is good  although the 3rd gear synchromesh is worn. The brakes are effective and the car has tight suspension and chassis  but it the steering does wander a bit as the driver gets in and out of the power and would likely benefit from an alignment at a minimum. <br> <br>This is a fundamentally unmolested 930 that feels much the way most of these cars did 10-15 years ago before collectors started jumping on them. The underside of the engine is oily and the paint is presentable but not perfect  and there has not really been any significant restorative work performed. But this car escaped the fate of many 930s  namely the host of invasive modifications often deployed on these cars. A matching numbers example finished in its period original color  this car has books  tools  and is basically unmodified. It is also a structurally excellent lifetime California car  and could easily be used as is  comprehensively refurbished  or gradually improved as it is driven.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$82,500               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Porsche faithful weren't ready for a mid-engined entry-level Porsche, but the passage of time proves that cars like this 1976 Porsche 914 are a very affordable way to have an air-cooled Porsche on a budget, and it's one that doesn't turn around and bite you in the corners!<br> <br> This bright yellow Porsche looks like it should cost a lot more than it does. You can lay some of the blame on the fact that 914s haven't caught on with collectors in a meaningful way, and maybe some on the fact that it was designed from the start to be relatively affordable. But I think that does this neat little mid-engined sports car a real disservice, because even at a glance it looks like a party on wheels. The bright yellow paint isn't subtle, but if you have a Porsche sports car do you really want to stay anonymous? Panel fit is good and these were well-built cars with Porsche's traditionally high standards of build quality, and time does nothing to diminish that fact. The paint is older but shines up nicely and for a machine that you're going to want to use regularly, it's more than presentable. The black details, including the big bumper up front and the targa roof, look excellent against the yellow paint and show very little evidence of UV damage or fading. Lenses, stainless trim, and the luggage rack out back all attest to the fact that someone has really cared for this car. <br> <br> The interior is highlighted by the funky plaid seats, which were part of the package in 1976 and make this Porsche an awesome trip back in time. The thin-shell buckets are featherweight and comfortable, and the driving position is arguably better than that of an early 911. Big, round dials with the tach in the center will look familiar to anyone who has been in an air-cooled Porsche in the past, with secondary controls that are sensibly, if a little cryptically laid out. There's a newer Blaupunkt AM/FM/CD stereo in the center of the dash and we have to admit that the green carpets work rather well in the yellow car with plaid seats. The roof lifts off easily and stows in the surprisingly spacious trunk, making this a true open-air cruiser. And with both front and rear trunks, there's a great deal of storage space.<br> <br> The engine is an air-cooled 2.0 liter flat-four, a machine familiar to those of you who also may have driven a 912. The car is mid-engined, meaning that the engine lives right behind the passenger compartment and ahead of the rear axle, which is a direct contrast to the rear-engined 911, whose tail-happy antics are well documented. Service access is actually decent since it was designed to be accessed from below, but we'll admit it's not as easy as just lifting the hood (just ask Boxter owners how they like it). It starts with a familiar flat-four bark from the dual exhaust and idles like it's eager to get on with it. The 4-speed manual transmission snaps through the gears neatly, with shift feel somewhere between a Beetle and a 911, and the all-independent suspension is competent. In fact, this car is an awesome example of the idea that it's far more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow. Not that this is a terribly slow car, but thanks to its high cornering limits and benign road manners, there's more suspension than the engine can use, and that means FUN. Powerful disc brakes are there to bail you out and it sits on 14-inch alloy wheels with recent Dunlop radials.<br> <br> With a stack of service receipts, this neat little 914 delivers big fun, great looks, and a lot of charisma for not a lot of cash.

The inclusion of Variocam Plus (as opposed to Variocam on the earlier 996) improved power delivery through the rpm range. The headlights on the 996 Carrera also adopted the turbo headlights of the MK1 iteration. Seat belt pretensioners were added. In 2000 the Tiptronic transmission was modified to allow it to enter manual mode by clicking buttons on the steering wheel.Updates also included a revised front bumper to decrease front end lift and the addition of a glove box. The second generation 996 gained 25 kg (55 lb) in the facelift. In response to criticism that the Carrera had become too refined in 2002 the Carrera 4S came with many options including lowered suspension and sports exhaust. It proved popular and set the pattern for the 997 Carrera S versions (re; Wikipedia)This 911 is in excellent condition with only 24705 actual miles.

The '80s created some outrageous supercars, but few were as recognizable and accessible as the legendary 911 Turbo, or 930. In 1988, Porsche only imported 591 Turbo cabriolets, and for those lucky few, the experience is like no other. The 911 Turbo is a living legend without equal.<br> <br> With a fantastic restoration on a super-clean 54k original mile car, this stunning Guards Red Turbo looks every bit the supercar. Finish quality when it was new was exemplary and it has been expertly repainted by the experts at Advantage Autoworks in September of 2014 so it shows spectacularly well. Every single panel is straight, smooth, and beautifully fitted, because build quality on the 911 has always been exceptional. Euro headlight lenses give it a purposeful look and there's simply nothing like Porsche's version of bright red draped across a wide-body 911 to attract attention. Fit and finish are, of course, world-class in every way, and it seems that Porsche engineers were able to cut off the roof without upsetting the car's rock-solid body structure. Heck, even the black rubber components like the massive ''whale tail'' rear spoiler, despite living down south, are supple and rich, defying the sun's rays. You want attention? Even 24 years later, this one is a total eyeball magnet!<br> <br> If the gorgeous black leather interior seems to defy the years, that's because it was completely reupholstered by ASM Auto Upholstery (yes, the same ones as on TV!). Contrasting red piping and bright red door panels tie it together with the bodywork but don't get overwhelming. The factory gauges spring to life with a turn of the key, and you'd better keep an eye on that boost gauge, because when it starts to move, you'd better have this bullet pointed where you want to go. Almost everything was standard, including power windows, a power canvas top, and A/C, and the stereo on this car has been upgraded with a Blaupunkt AM/FM/CD head unit that fits like the factory did it and powers a set of upgraded speakers in the doors. The black canvas top fits well, but if you're doing things correctly, you'll never need it, and the front-mounted trunk is in excellent original condition, right down to the original mats.<br> <br> Given the outrageous performance potential locked inside the 3.3 liter flat-six, it was popular to tweak them for more boost, but at the cost of reduced engine life. This one remains entirely stock and was completely rebuilt, along with the turbo itself, at 49,000 miles by Louden Motorcar Services, so it runs and drives exceptionally well. And lest you think that a stock 930 engine is no big deal, I suggest you put this one on the pavement and see if you lose your nerve before it runs out of boost; my money's on the car. Turbo enthusiasts seem to prefer the old-style 4-speed manual gearbox and purists will appreciate that the early Turbo's ''frisky'' personality comes through loud and clear; you really need to be a the top of your game to see all that this car has to show you. Powerful cross-drilled disc brakes are there just in case, and it rides on a set of brand new Fuchs wheels wearing new Hankook radials. <br> <br> Extensively documented with receipts and maintenance records, this is a Turbo that you can buy (and drive!) with confidence. Isn't it time you owned a legend? Call today!</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$112,995               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

This is a European model as this car as you see it didn't come to the U.S. till 1987.  You had to go to the plant and special order this car and get all of the DOT things put on it and have it shipped over.  This 34 year old car as you will see in the pics presents exceptionally well.  The red paint is miles deep and just draws you right in.  This car also comes with the original leather satchel with the original tools in it.  This is one of those cars that just immediately takes you back to the days of the ''Miami Vice'' era.</p> <p>The interior of this car is an absolute time capsule.  The only thing that has been changed is the radio which has been upgraded to a AM/FM/CD unit.  The leather interior, dash, headliner, and carpet all present very well for the age of the car.  When you slide in to these seats they just hug you.  This car is extremely comfortable and very fun to drive.  It needs to be in your garage.</p> <p>Now for the business end of things.  The 3.3 Liter Turbo motor out back just purrs like a kitten with that signature Porsche sound.  This motor was rated at 300 HP, but wouldn't take much at all to up that number if you wanted to.  This motor runs like a top and the transmission is silky smooth.  When you hit 3rd in this car it becomes a rocket ship so get ready to take off.</p> <p>If you want a car that handles like it's on rails and has the comfort of a luxury sedan, then this is the car you must have.  Relive the good old days of the 80's today and make this your car.  We have classic car financing for those that would like to take advantage of the option.

The goal was to prepare an all-out campaign in the new European Grand Touring Championship Group 5 with a 911-based model called the RSR. To meet the FIA's production requirements, Porsche would have to construct at least 500 examples of a Group 4-legal model with a 2.7-litre engine that could be enlarged to the Group 5 maximum of 3.0 litres. Using the 911 S as a starting point, the Carrera RS boasted numerous changes in an effort to reduce weight and add power. Weighing just 2,370 pounds, the Carrera RS boasted a top speed of 150 mph and a 0–60 mph time of just 5.5 seconds.</p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

It's pretty hard to improve on that history. This car has just come out of long term storage although according to the seller it was started on a very regular basis and driven a few miles at a time. When it came out of storage it was trucked to re-nouned Porsche Specialist Marc Bixen's Red Line Services for a thorough service. Almost $6,000.00 later the car was finished and is ready to be used and enjoyed. Red Line changed all the brake hoses, wheel cylinders and the brake master cylinder and reservoir. The brakes and valves were adjusted and the carbs resealed. Fuel was drained from the tank and lines flushed and the same with done with brake fluid and lines. The car comes with its Porsche Certificate of Authenticity showing production was completed November 26, 1962. It also shows the car is still finished in its original colour combination. Optional equipment on the car included Ventilated Chrome Wheels, Exterior Mirror, Blaupunkt Berlin Radio, 2 Loud Speakers, Antenna, Hubcaps with Crest and Conti Tyres were fitted. The car still has the original outside mirrors and Blaupunkt radio. It also has a period correct Nardi Wood rim steering wheel. Missing is the spare wheel and original tool roll that somehow got misplaced over the years. Wheels are date coded showing 3 with 7/62 date and 1 with 10/62 which is in keeping with the production date of the car. The engine and transmission show the same numbers that appear on the Certificate of Authenticity. A little Porsche trivia, the license plate on Janis Joplin's 356 Cabriolet was VAN990 (Last picture below), this car wears VAN930 which would indicate they were licensed probably on the same day at the same Department of Motor Vehicles office in California.  This is not a restored car but one that is an original example although re-painted many years ago. A replacement convertible top has been fitted some time ago as well. The mileage indicated of 71,125 is believed to be a pretty accurate account. Pride of ownership is evident as it still shows really well. Finished in a special order colour, Porcelain White (#6220) with Black interior and Top.      </p><p> </p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$139,995               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

These are the cars that made Porsche renowned as a creator of highly desirable sports cars that continues today. With its rear engine, unusual styling and high performance the 356 is regarded as one of the most influential automotive designs in history. This C model represents a major step forward for Porsche with the introduction of full disc brakes and an engine that is far removed from the early VW based engine design. The 356C is important because it is all Porsche and represents the final culmination of development for the ''bathtub'' Porsches that began in 1948 with a design by ''Ferry'' Porsche.</p> <p>The car, consigned to the Saratoga Auto Auction, has been in the same ownership for 20-years and has only 61,000 miles.</p> <p>The color is the original factory supplied Ivory White and the four-seat interior has been redone in tan leather, a common upgrade from the original vinyl seats.</p> <p>The Porsche 356C features what was then the revolutionary Porsche air-cooled flat 4-cylinder pushrod engine. A pair of Zenith 32 NDIX carburetors feed the 1600cc engine, which puts puts out some 88hp.</p> <p>The engine is teamed with the highly regarded Porsche 742 fully synchronized four-speed gearbox. As the original Porsche design, the engine is rear mounted on a steel chassis.</p> <p>There are some styling clues, like larger windows and the dual air intakes on the rear lid, that differentiate the 356C from the earlier A and B models but it is the use of disc brakes on all four corners, the first Porsches to have all disc brakes, that makes the C special. Combined with newly dampened steering, stiffened front anti-roll bar and softer torsion bars the C is reputed to be the best handling of the 356 models.</p> <p>This is an excellent example of a popular and coveted sports car that will only continue to be appreciated by its new owner in the coming years.</p> <p>ESTIMATE: $70,000 - $85,000</p>             <p>              Auction               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

With the same Atlanta owner, an active PCA member, for the past 22 years, who has spared no expense on mechanical or cosmetic upkeep.  Clean CarFax with no accident history; 72,000 original miles. COA.</p> <p>Details are slim regarding this 930's early life - it was imported by a Mr. Jurgen Van Beekum and federalized by South Coast Compliance in 1985. In 1992 it was sold to a Dallas Cowboys defensive end who kept it three years until the current owner's purchase in late 1995. The Slantnose conversion and RUF upgrades were completed prior to our client's purchase in '95.  We believe this to be a high-quality, steel conversion based on the twin headlight motors used - Porsche kept no records of factory Slantnose builds in 1985, so even if it is a factory build it would not be listed on the COA or option sticker.</p> <p>Speaking of the RUF build, this goes far beyond a badge and some gauges. Genuine RUF parts abound including the sought-after dogleg five-speed gearbox, gauges, intercooler/intake system and more. Complete engine rebuild 11,000 miles ago at a cost of nearly $40,000. The turbo, waste gate and fuel system have been upgraded and it's running stainless B&amp;B exhaust.</p> <p>We've driven lots of 930s but never one quite this impressive - boost builds fast, and the close gear ratios allow you to keep the turbo spooled between shifts. It's totally streetable but way more flexible and much faster than a stock 930. It's also remarkably dry underneath.</p> <p>A high quality repaint was commissioned in 1996 in the correct A1 Black finish and it remains in stunning condition - always garaged and covered when not in use. Likewise the interior shows beautifully with some ''enhancements'' typical of the period (leather-clad Recaros, door card accents, tasteful but upgraded stereo).</p> <p>There is nothing quite like a Slantnose with the right (and very expensive) go-fast parts thrown at it - a truly iconic 1980s supercar that is as exhilarating to drive as it is to look at. This is a high-quality example that's had a caring long-term owner and would be a nice addition to any collection. COA, records and tools included.

The previous owner tells us it is a no-hit car with all of its original panels and floor pan. The only thing that needed to be replaced was the battery pan. It has near perfect gaps; the doors make that ''ting'' sound when you shut them; and the proper fit and finish all over this car makes this a rare Pre-A indeed. The tan interior and top are very well done and they remain in excellent condition. The engine currently in the car is a smoked-over 912 with plenty of horsepower to ''get it done'' while a stock engine (#60339) is also included. To help the car's drivability a 1958 356 steering box and 15? wheels (16? wheels included) are currently on the car. These tackle the only real faults of a Pre-A, its tractor-like steering and its very narrow tire contact patch on the road. This is a terrific Speedster to enjoy on sunny days, and to satisfy that itch that needs scratching without spending double the money for a concours trailer queen that you won't let the kids near.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$318,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

The folks in Stuttgart have single-handedly built an 86-year legacy out of performance-minded engineering, while designing some of the most endearing cars ever produced. And today, as one of the most well respected automakers on the planet, the brand enjoys a tremendous following that was forged through cars like this 1973 911S. Perhaps the best rendition of the original 911, this storied coupe is a fully documented Porsche Parade winner that, in its present condition, is the stuff of purists' dreams. And if you're a discerning enthusiast who's ready to experience the essence of the Porsche brand, it's an excellent candidate for your next classic!</p> <p>HISTORY/CONDITION</p> <p>As car enthusiasts, we all know that every serious sports car manufacturer sells various levels of capability. And, much like Ferrari's GTO or Corvette's Grand Sport, Porsche's S moniker essentially guarantees hardware that can handle intense track time. Like Detroit's greatest muscle cars, the late '60s 911 found itself in a pre-regulation sweet spot that set the stage for a series of models that are notably potent and incredibly desirable. The simplicity and purity of the original 911 design, introduced in 1964, was still very much intact. And when combined with a corporate culture that obsessed over weight reduction, it created one of the greatest analog drivers ever produced. In 1969, Porsche began stroking its powerplants to increased displacements. And by 1973, that innovation had created a car that enjoyed a fleet 12.7 pounds-per-horsepower weight ratio. That's when car enthusiasts Suzie Hunt and Scott Campbell decided to throw caution to the wind and seriously upgrade their mode of transportation. When the couple signed the paperwork for a $13K loan, the loan officer said that was the most expensive car the credit union had ever financed. The problem was, Porsche dealers were only allotted six 911S each and, since it was late in the model year, most cars were already spoken for. That is, unless you went to Vasek Polak, a personal friend of Dr. Ferry Porsche who, in 1959, had opened America's first exclusive Porsche dealership. Vasek had managed to talk the factory in to sending him twelve 911S, and one of them, this Porsche Silver Metallic beauty, found its first home with Suzie and Scott.</p> <p>When the 911 arrived at Polak's, it was one of two cars, of its 6-unit S car lot, that had been optioned with a $447 sunroof. In fact, when that sunroof was combined with the coupe's other options - fog lights, Recaro seats, an AM/FM cassette deck and a 5-speed manual transaxle, it was priced almost as much as a 2.7RS that Vasek was somehow peddling as a street legal beast. But, after a bit of consideration, the couple decided to stick with the S. Unfortunately, the car's paint was damaged during shipping. After a bit of hemming and hawing, Polak agreed to repainting its back-half, and that's when a set of buff RS fender flares were added. Scott and Suzie wasted no time stretching the 911's legs, making an all-out run from Reno to Salt Lake City long before events like the Silver State Classic Challenge were even considered. Their rules were simple: obey established speed limits, which, in 1973, amounted to just townships, and keep the car above 100 MPH. The result was an average speed of 95.8 MPH, with top speeds of 130 MPH for Suzie and 150 MPH for Scott, accomplished on a long, downhill charge. The next three years would see Scott and Suzie dominate Porsche Club of America autocross events across Nevada and Northern California. In 1977, Suzie won the Porsche Club of America Porsche Parade. And, circa 1999, Suzie would finally pass the car to its second owner.</p> <p>Today, roughly 2 years out of a substantial freshening that included new paint and fresh window seals, this awesome sports car is one of the purest classics on the planet! At the front of its body, a stretched nose hangs requisite Stuttgart-inspired branding over a stylish, color-keyed bumper. At the sides of that nose, classic Porsche headlights and small driving lamps illuminate clear parking lights, correct horn grilles and a new-for-1973 chin spoiler. At the top of the car, like-new glass rides between spotless stainless trim, correct black wipers and a chrome driver's mirror. Beneath that glass, subtle rocker guards trace factory door handles and the aforementioned fender flares. At the back of the car, a correct black grille diffuses air above black ''911S'' lettering and a correct ''PORSCHE'' script. And below that grille, tri-color tail lamps illuminate a second, color-keyed bumper, which frames a Vasek Polak tag frame.</p> <p>ENGINE</p> <p>This 911's 2.4 liter flat 6-cylinder, professionally overbored to 2.7 liters, is notable for a variety of reasons. Naturally, weight reduction was a primary goal, and the car's plastic intake, a phenomenon largely equated with the 1990s, was a positive step in that direction. Additionally, that intake funneled air in a manner which built positive pressure at the engine's intake valves creating a sort of miniature supercharger effect. And that pressurized air worked well with fuel injection that maintained 350psi. Today, Porsche's 2.4 liter is widely regarded as one of Stuttgart's best powertrains, featuring a great combination of race-proven technology and road-ready smoothness. And, based on appearance, the silky engine has been meticulously maintained.</p> <p>DRIVETRAIN/SUSPENSION</p> <p>In addition to its classic appearance and minimal heft, this generation of 911 is vehemently praised for exceptional handling. Couple that with this coupe's optional 5-speed, and one begins to understand why Suzie Hunt was so successful at autocross events. The 2.7 liter loves to rev, and the 5-speed optimizes the engine's power through excellent gearing. Why does that proven track record matter? Because it enhances this 911's already excellent driving characteristics, making the car even more desirable than its 4-speed brethren. At the corners of the chassis, adjustable Koni shocks frame tough disc brakes. And forged Fuchs wheels, staggered to fit the car's RS fender flares, spin 2-year-old Pirelli P6000s sized 185/70R15 up front and 215/60R15 out back.</p> <p>INTERIOR</p> <p>Pop this Porsche's solid-closing doors and you'll find a simple Black interior that's the perfect spot to spend the afternoon cruising. The car's passengers enjoy factory sport seats, anchored by fade-free carpet, which is protected by snazzy, aftermarket floor mats. In front of those seats, a monochromatic dash props a crack-free pad above slightly canted gauges, fresh Classic Auto Air conditioning and a vintage Blaupunkt tape deck. And in front of the driver, a simple, Porsche-branded steering wheel keeps everyone pointed in the right direction.</p> <p>OUR SALE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTATION AND ACCESSORIES</p>   Vintage marketing materials<br>  An original Odometer Mileage Statement<br>  Vintage registration cards<br>  Historical photographs<br>  Vintage magazine articles<br>  Vintage, hand-written value statements<br>  Service records and receipts<br>  A partial ownership history<br>  The car's Porsche Certificate of Authenticity<br>  A vintage tool kit<br>  A vintage California license plate<br>  <p>This 911S is, without a doubt, one of the coolest Porsches ever produced.

The 911 came about because of outgoing models and the need for a bit more performance. The 'S' model in the 911 lineup stood for Super and that it was. The Porsche 911 S can reach 0-60 right around the 6-second mark and will gladly give you some serious driving pleasure. If you'd rather stare at it, that works too. The styling was to become iconic with the 911 lineup. The smooth curves and overall look of the car was something to gloat about if yours, and something to be jealous of if not. To say the 911 succeeded would be an understatement, as it is still going strong today. With the 911 lineup being that of comfortable and purposeful interiors with the flowing lines of the exterior, the 1967 911 S was no exception. It was meant to combine all the great aspects of the 911 series cars before it and add a bit more power.For more information on this extremely rare 1967 Porsche 911S, or any of our 40+ Porsches always in stock, contact one of our friendly and knowledgeable sales consultants today or always feel free to stop by our Bellevue, WA Park Place Ltd campus - where we have over 40,000 sq ft of indoor showrooms filled with the finest cars.

On top of that, the gauges come with exclusive neon green needles in place of the old gauge needles. A glance to the right locates the center console's master control. While it has a dizzying number of switches, they are logically grouped and easily mastered. Navigation information is viewed on a screen in the center of the dash.

They were winning everything from Le Mans, Hill Climbs, famous rallys to even club sport racing of the time.   It appeared Porsche had something figured out with its rear-engine, SWB design.  Not to mention it put out a ton more power with the same displacement as other manufacturers.  It was initially dubbed the ''901'', however Peugeot protested on the grounds that in France hit had exclusive rights to that for another automobile.  I wont get in to too much of the Porsche History here as most people that are looking at this ad claim to know more than there fellow Porschefile so here are some of the details on the car itself.  It was built  January, 2 1969 and was sold new in Huntington Beach, CA on July 3, 1969 where it remained with the first owner until around 1974 when it was sold to a gentleman in Michigan.  It appears that the first major engine overhaul was done at Williams Porsche of Lansing in 1978 with receipts in hand.  It was driven a couple more years until it was stored in a cottage garage for nearly 30 years getting driven on occasion.  It then traded hands again, this time needing a restoration.  After consulting several Porsche people and professionals, it was determined to only give the car a Mechanical restoration and leave everything else alone. It was determined that the car was completely original down to the paint.  Yes, there is some cosmetic rust issues in some of the normal spots but this is by no means a mess.  It is still very presentable.  A full mechanical, engine out restoration was done, including top end, carbs, valves etc...all rubber, wheel cylinders, brakes, linkages and assorted other odds and ends that totaled around $15,000.00 was just completed this spring.  It has numbers matching engine and trans as indicated on the Porsche COA and pictures to back it up.  The Targa top is still original with the exception of the headliner being replaced due to it falling apart.  The rest of the interior is 100% original.   I have the original owners manual and keys,  the radio still works as it should and the car runs fantastic.  This is a must see if you are a collector or if you just want a 911 that everyone at a PCA event will not stop talking about.  We all know what Restored 911's go for but that's because finding an original one is near impossible to find.  Do yourself a favor and come check this one out.

This deal ended up being a little more complicated however as we had to purchase all the classic cars from his estate to get this Flachbau. Now we all know I love an honest car with a great story and this is it. The owner Don loved this car; his best friend told me the car lasted longer than his two marriages. Don bought it in January of 1994 from Champion Porsche and he drove it! Just two years later he had already 29,900 miles on it and he didn't slow down from there. In 2005 he had more than 155,000 miles on the odometer but then he started to slow down, adding only 4000 more miles since then to reach its now 162,700 original miles. Yup! You read that correctly: he drove and drove and drove! This was my kind of guy. The original paint is exactly what you'd expect from a car with this kind of mileage but it is all original with the exception of a repainted front bumper cover. Paint meters don't lie and this car reads 4.5 to 10.0 and it has all its VIN stickers on the panels. There are a few chips and some peppering on the hood, above the stone guards and the lower rockers, a couple of dings on the left fender (our ding guy won't touch alloy) and that's about it.  Killer patina tells the story. The interior is very nice also and you only can tell the mileage by the driver's side seat bolster and carpet (worn through). We just serviced the car and performed a leak down test because no records except the Carfax were available. The leak down passed with flying colors revealing less than 10% on all cylinders. The remainder of the service involved replacing a few sensors, hood shocks, and a couple of plastic trim pieces, oil, etc. There was nothing major. The original Speedline wheels had some curb rash and crazing but Porsche had a couple original sets left! So $14,000 later, the wheels and new Michelin Pilot Sport tires are perfect. The original window sticker, keys and pouch, and manuals are all in the glove box. With the last few low mileage cars bringing over a $1,000,000 and a 30,000-mile European car with plenty of paintwork fetching $760,000, this is the deal on a Flachbau!</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$345,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

This car has a rich documented history to compliment its wonderful original condition. This Carerra represents a unique opportunity to acquire a collector quality, limited-production 911 with fantastic detailed documentation and provenance.  </p><p>Chassis # 9114600947 was first delivered on the 17th of May 1974, to the Crown Prince of Bahrain at the Porsche Factory in Stuttgart, Germany. During the Prince's ownership his prized possession moved with him from country to country. First port of call was Bahrain. Subsequent moves were to Paris, in July of 1981, then to Geneva, in May of 1992, and finally to London, in 1994, all confirmed by the wonderful documentation on hand. Carrera # 947 was always lavishly stored and maintained, being driven only 25,785 miles or 41,256 kms, in its nearly 20 years of Royal Ownership. On the 19th of February 1998, The Prince finally sold his Treasure to Mr. S. Bridgland of Surrey. In 2001 it changed hands again, selling to Mr. J. Thompson, of Hampshire. He owned it right up to the time of it being sold to and imported to the United States in 2012.</p><p>#947 Starts easily, even when cold. Once warm the car pulls away effortlessly with a lightly weighted take up from the clutch. The 915 gearbox shifts beautifully; free of any friction or hesitation. The steering is light and precise and the car displays just a little roll on turn in. The ride is compliant without being harsh despite its sporty set up. The brakes give a satisfying, confident bite once pressed into service. The motor is fantastic; free of  any smoke, displays an even tempered idle and bellows that iconic air-cooled wail from the rear that will send shivers up your back. The engine is immediately reactive to throttle inputs and has a crisp, elegant power delivery. One that invites you to summon higher and higher revs. </p><p> There is a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, showing #947 to be all numbers matching. #947 comes complete with a comprehensive folder documenting its' provenance, chain of ownership, service records and safety inspections, all confirming the mileage. The car has had one rotisserie repaint in the unique and factory original special order color, Porsche code Z6, Copper Brown Metallic. All the mechanicals, engine, gearbox and suspension were all done to show standards at that time. The interior is all original, and a testament to its low mileage and the loving care it has received throughout its entire life. The car's Royal Provenance, chain of ownership, certified low miles, extraordinary condition, and multiple class and division awards let you know you have a blue chip, investment grade, quality vehicle on offer here. Consider also the unique special order paint, unusual gold Carrera script and wheels, factory air conditioning, electric windows, full leather interior and factory sport seats.

He special-ordered the car in Dolphin Grey, adding chrome wheels and seat belts. He took the car home and there it remained for the next 50+ years! At first only John drove the car; decades later his son got his chance. The dry southern California climate has preserved this car like none we have ever seen.</p> <p>Documentation on this car is very cool. John showed the 356 Cabriolet in a concours d'elegance once in August 1971, at the Hollywood Bowl! A local pipe shop used it in their advertisements (and we have one of these ads in the paperwork.) The Shaler company (think Lucas-type oils) wrote him a note suggesting what oil would work best in his Cabriolet. The original window sticker, service book, and original tool kit are all included (though a few tools are missing) and all these items back up the story on this car.</p> <p>The car is untouched and has never even been concours detailed so it remains incredibly original. The original paint is spectacular and it has had only one small spot touched up many moons ago. None of the trim has ever been removed, and the finish on those parts is exemplary!

Life circumstances are forcing sale. The vehicle has received regular maintenance and has always been garage kept; it has been a weekend driver for the last 5 years with less than 20K miles during that time. The vehicle was recently (Sept 2017) serviced at Oswalt's in Mesquite with an oil change and A/C service. A full inspection of the car was done at the time, see below for details.</p><p>At the time the vehicle was serviced there are two items noted that will need to be addressed by the new owner.  First is a rough shift between 1st and 2nd the mechanic says will require opening the transmission to diagnose and repair.  Second is a very minor oil leak.  The vehicle does not leave puddles on the garage floor nor does the engine smoke.</p><p>CarFax report shows 35 entries with 0 accidents and 5 service records.  Most entries are for title transfers.  There are no known wrecks or rust.  The vehicle has been in Texas all its life.</p><p>Vehicle has working A/C, power windows, powerbrakes, and aftermarket Pioneer radio/cd player. Tires are in good shape and show even wear with back tires new within the past 2 years. There are a few minor blemishes we have attempted to show in the photos, but none over a quarter in size.  Paint still shows well.</p><p>Interior in good condition for its age and wasn't used as a kennel or pet transport.  There is one seam on passenger seat requiring attention and wear on the bolster for driver's seat.  Additionally the driver's door panel is cracked but may be salvagable.

Its discontinuation marked the end of air-cooled Porsches, with the 993 being the last air-cooled 911. The 993 generation of the 911 is often referred to as the best and most desirable of the 911 series, not only because of its beauty, but also because of its great performance, even by modern standards. The 993 is quoted as ''the last complete 'modern classic'''; ''the 993 was and forever will be that last fresh breath of air that Porsche gave the world; elegance and muscle all in one package.''</p> <p>GR Auto Gallery is pleased to present this gorgeous 1996 Porsche 911 Carrera C4S for consideration. Porsche enthusiasts all seem to agree that the 993 is the most desirable of all generations ever produced before the dawn of the water-cooled era, leading to steadily increasing values and growing scarcity. Some highlights of this Carrera include; black leather interior, dual exhaust system, all-wheel drive with limited slip differential and ABD stabilizer bars, turbo design wheels, integrated bumper w/fog lights and extendable rear spoiler, power sunroof, headlight washer, power steering, filtered A/C and heating with climate control, remote locking alarm system, power front seats and more.

This Porsche was built in December of 1972, and has held exclusive long term Californian ownership for its entire life. It was initially sold new from a dealership in San Jose, CA in 1973, lightly driven in the following 2 decades, then put in long term storage from 1993 to the mid-2010s. The car was then rediscovered in 2014 by a Northern California Porsche enthusiast who found the car at a garage in Pacific Grove, CA complete with its original Blue plates. The enthusiast got the car back on the road with routine service and maintenance before Classic Showcase acquired the example in 2015, starting the restoration work in the Spring of 2016.</p><p>Our team began the project by completely disassembling the car, which included the engine, interior and body trim, glass, and more. The car was then stripped to bare metal, metal finished, then painted in its original color of Gemini Blue, with the upholstery retrimmed in its original black interior colors using correct and proper materials. The sunroof was restored as well, along with the addition of a new headliner on the 911T's interior. The car's instruments were thoroughly cleaned and serviced, and all mechanical systems were brought up to specifications; a new battery was installed, along with new heat exchangers, new clutch and brake components, and the engine was put back to its original colors and all new rubber was installed throughout the car. The Porsche's original Fuchs wheels were fully restored, and new trim and other Porsche-specific items were purchased and installed, and the car also includes a fully functional Alpine stereo system with new speakers and antennae installed.</p><p>This 911T is sure to make a great choice for the eager Porsche collector looking for a restored example worthy of a drive along their favorite route, showing at events, or simply as a prudent Blue Chip investment.

Indeed, the designator “RS” - German for “Renn Sport” or “Race Sport,” is traditionally reserved for the highest performance Porsches. In a Porsche RS model, refinements in the suspension, steering, wheels and tires all work in combination with perfectly coordinated weight reduction to create a dramatically different driving feel.”</p><p>The intent was to create a basic lightweight, no frills 911 with minimal luxury options. Fitting the RS America with the M030 sport suspension package led to higher performance limits. The progressively wound coil springs, larger diameter front stabilizer bar, and upgraded shock absorbers were standard equipment for the RS America, as were 17” diameter C2 Turbo wheels. The RSA rims were 7” wide on the front and 8” wide on the rear. The interior of the RS America was rather special, utilizing a Black Cord Cloth Sport seats on the front panels with leather backs. The door panels are flat and sparse utilizing pull straps for opening them. The rear seats were deleted and replaced with a flat shelf with storage cabinets under the tray. A standard RS America came without air-conditioning, radio or sunroof, all removed to save weight. However, four options were available that included those deleted plus a limited slip diff. This car has two of the options air-conditioning (option 573) and power sunroof (option 650). It has had a radio/stereo installed. The RS America has the 3.6 litre 247 horsepower flat 6 engine coupled to the G50 5-speed gearbox. Weighing in at just under 3,000 pounds they made for excellent performance and along with brilliant handling a wonderful car to drive. Additional weight saving came from deleting power steering, power mirrors and cruise control. The service records we have date to 1996 with many from renowned locally renowned Porsche specialist Marc Bixen's Red Line Services. This is a superb example of car that shows pride of ownership with its appearance defying the cars mileage in the late 70'000s. It has been represented as never been raced on a track which many cannot say. The paint and interior are in stunning condition and again defy it's almost 25year age. We have the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity. This car is number 521 out of only 701 made, truly a rare modern classic. Many of these have been torn up and wrecked at Race Tracks throughout the world so that 701 examples built isn't representative now of what's left.

It was sold by the first owner in March 1978 with 57,200 miles and remained in CA.  It then was purchased with 79,400 miles, in December 1988.  All ownership and registration records are available, along with the Owner's Manual. The car was operated and garaged during the period he resided in CA or Arizona until April 2000.  It was then moved east to Maryland via enclosed auto carrier (Passport Transport).  In January 2003, he relocated to Virginia where car was currently registered.  It has been garaged and covered when not driven since he has owned it.  According to the second owner, it was garaged during his ownership.  Except for the front hood and lower spoiler, the paint is the factory original, as are the Carrera Graphics. The hood was stripped to bare metal, primed and repainted in January 2017.  The Targa top was completely refurbished, the front seats were recovered with the original type of perforated pigskin leather, in the original midnight color and new foam padding was installed, and the carpets were dyed to the original black.  This work was done in August 1999.</p> <p>Maintenance History</p> <p>The car has been routinely maintained with fluids and filters replaced.

If you were a car guy back in the late '70s and early '80s, this was the car that filled your dreams and dominated pop culture. Today, it remains a heck of a lot of fun and probably not a bad investment, either.<br> <br> This particular slantnose conversion is by Rinspeed with a full aero kit, and it looks every bit the supercar that it is. Guards Red paint is really the only color you want on your rock star 911 and more than a few of these adorned posters, TV shows, and movies of the period. The conversion is seamless and every bit as good as the factory work, giving the familiar 911 an entirely different personality. The paint is an older respray, so it's got some age on it, but as a testament to the quality of the work and the car it has received, it still looks pretty good, although it's certainly seen better days. The wide rear fenders with gill-like vents give it a hyper-aggressive look and the ''whale tail'' spoiler borrowed from the Turbo balances the outrageous nose treatment. You'll also note that the black rubber parts are in good shape, there's a wing-style third brake light above the rear window, and even a ''Turbo'' badge on the rear end to complete the illusion. Honestly, would you tangle with this car on the street, despite its age? Heck no!<br> <br> The handsome red leather interior is tasteful the way Porsches always are. The handsome bucket seats wear recent seat covers that fit well and work well with the matching dash, console, and door panels. The controls will feel familiar to anyone who has driven a 911 of any vintage, although the red wheel is an extravagant piece that can only work in an outrageous car like this. White-faced gauges put the tach where it belongs, right in the middle, and the secondary controls, while confusing to a newcomer, are arrayed sensibly just below. The red carpets are a little tired and could stand to be replaced, but the rest is quite serviceable as-is. The entertainment system is a newer AM/FM/CD stereo that sounds good only until about 3000 RPM, then the engine's howl takes center stage. There's also factory A/C which is fairly effective on a warm day, and even with the slantnose conversion, the forward trunk is still reasonably spacious.<br> <br> The 911's 2.7 liter flat-six is legendary for its reliability and power. If you want a daily driver supercar, this is probably it, and it has been upgraded with an MSD ignition system but is otherwise stock. It's torquey, yet loves to rev and never feels like you could catch it sleeping. The engine bay is dressed up only with a red cooling fan, although the A/C compressor is recent and now upgraded to use R134a refrigerant. The 5-speed manual gearbox needs no coaxing and feels surprisingly direct, although the floor-hinged clutch will take some familiarization if you've never driven an early 911 before. The suspension's limits are quite high, even by today's standards, and with the big tires, the 911's tail-happy reputation is tamed somewhat and there are always a set of giant disc brakes to bail you out. Oversized Fuchs-style 3-piece alloy wheels with color-matched inserts wear Turbo-sized rubber, with 225/50/15s up front and massive 345/35/15 Pirellis out back.<br> <br> This is your chance to own the icon you dreamed about when you were a kid, and thanks to some very careful owners, it's still nicely preserved and ready to enjoy.

,Porsche,911S,,911S Targa,1973,90650,Emeryville,CA ,2018-04-25,145000,Used,Dealership,,Dark Red Metallic,Black Leather,,,1973 Porsche 911S Targa,https://www.hemmings.com/classifieds/dealer/porsche/911s/2047764.html,,"<p>1973 Porsche 911S Targa<br>s/n 9113310785  engine no. *6331835*<br>Metallic Red with Black Leather Interior<br><br>The early 70s Porsche 911 combines an evocative vintage experience with superb road manners and drivability  particularly when compared with other cars of the same period.  There is a certain wholeness  cohesiveness  agility  and communicativeness that is only evident when they are driven  and they are extremely usable in modern traffic. This has made them particularly sought after by enthusiasts and collectors who are interested in driving their cars.<br><br>Early 911s were continuously developed  and the 1972 and 1973 models are generally considered the most refined and usable of the bunch. The 2.4 liter engine (technically 2.3 liters at 2341cc) provided more torque  and the S model was the most desirable  providing the highest level of equipment and the most power. By 1974  the weight of the cars was up somewhat due to the new impact bumpers  and the engine's character and power output softened appreciably thanks to the new CIS fuel injection system  which helped emissions but lacked the urgency and edginess of the previous MFI setup.<br><br>The Targa was a unique and typically Porsche solution to the desire to combine open air motoring with safety. There were persistent rumors that convertibles would be outlawed in the United States  so Porsche engineered an integrated roll over bar which became a defining and iconic part of the 911. The first Targa arrived for the 1967 model year  initially with zip out plastic rear window or fixed glass heated rear window  which was more or less standardized by 1970.<br><br>This 1973 911S Targa is a documented three-owner California blue and yellow plate car  delivered new to Niello Porsche-Audi in Sacramento  California August 29  1973. Originally finished in coffee brown  this car retains its matching numbers engine and transmission  per the included Certificate of Authenticity. The original warranty voucher and various service stamps include notations up to 58 620 indicated miles in 1979. There is also a massive stack of documentation with invoices dating back to the 1970s to support the mileage and California ownership history. The third and current owner purchased the car in the late 1990s  and set about performing a comprehensive 5-year restoration to high standards  which was completed in 2003. At the time of his purchase  the car had sport seats  which are believed to be original to the car. <br><br>Over the past several years  the current owner has performed the following items including a comprehensive engine rebuild with modern updates to the original specifications. The restoration included new injectors  rebuilt injector pump (by Pacific)  hydraulic chain tensioners  new cadmium plating as needed  new SSI stainless steel heat exchangers  new muffler  powder coated cylinder baffles  new oil tank  the case was align bored  Dilavar rods  new plugs and high voltage wires were installed  and the engine was dyno tested (test results included in documentation) before installation. Most of the engine parts were supplied by the highly regarded Porsche specialist Jerry Woods Racing  who also did the machine work to the case  crank  rods  cylinders  rods  pistons  and heads. A new clutch and Wevo shifter were also installed  and the gearbox rebuilt  including new synchros  bearings  and miscellaneous other parts. Inside the car  the sport seats were recovered with correct leather material  new carpeting (including front trunk) was installed  as was a new dash  new sun visors  new steering wheel cover  and new door and dash trim. Once the car was finished  it was sent to Jerry Woods  who performed the setup and final fettling on the car.<br><br>Originally metallic brown  the exterior was treated to a bare metal repaint using an original 1970 Porsche color  simply referred to as red metallic  with color code L97D. The refinishing included stripping the body and repainting the inside of the trunk  engine compartment  and door jambs as well as the exterior. All chrome trim was replated and all rubber trim  door seals  window seals and moldings replaced as needed. The wheels were refinished  and new brakes (master cylinder and pads) were installed. The front and rear A-arm bushings were replaced and new shocks were also installed  as were Turbo tie rods. A stamp in the original maintenance book indicates that the odometer was replaced at 13 236 miles in 1974 and the car currently shows 90 638 miles  suggesting that the original mileage is 104 000. In July of 2017  less than 200 miles ago  Porsche of Livermore performed $3 300 of service work  including five new Pirelli P600 tires were installed  and various other service related items including minor repairs  an oil service  gear oil change  and replacement of front and the rear hood and lid struts.<br><br>Today the car presents very nicely overall with excellent finishes that still look crisp. The paintwork was done to high standards and remains nice  with light road wear and  in certain light  some splotchiness that resembles water spots  which is present only on the left rear fender and right door. Rubber trim is generally nice  with some pieces showing signs of minor wear or aging. The various stainless and other bright trim throughout the car is in very nice condition with excellent fit and polish. The chrome headlight trim  side view mirrors  and door handles are in very nice condition as well.  The rear and side glass are in very good condition overall with no major marks of note. The windshield has two very minor chips but is otherwise very nice overall. The doors  hood  and deck lid all open and shut as expected  retaining factory fit and tight closures. The forged Fuchs wheels are nicely preserved with minor signs of road use and no notable rim edge damage. <br><br>The interior has been nicely refinished with new leather seat covers  and interior components as noted. Instruments are in nice visual condition overall and retain good function  bright contrasting dial faces  and clear lenses. The underside of the car is in impressively nice  with beautiful original floor pants  which have never been replaced or even refinished. The engine is clean and correct in appearance  above and below  aside from the fitment of stainless SSI heat exchangers. The removable Targa roof remains in very good cosmetic and functional condition with no surface abrasions or excessive sun damage. <br><br>From a driving perspective  this is an incredibly well-resolved example. The engine runs beautifully. MFI can be finicky but this one is perfectly dialed  revving in a clean  linear fashion  and delivering a thrilling rush in the upper rev range. The Wevo shifter meaningfully improves the action of the 915 gearbox  with a robust  mechanical feel  and a spring-loaded centering effect which addresses the common complaints about vagueness in these gearboxes. The steering has the magical talkative lightness of the early 911 and the suspension is tight and well-judged. This is a car that simply feels coherent and satisfying from the get-go and  like a properly set up 911 should  begs to be driven enthusiastically. The car is accompanied a significant amount of extra items including tool roll with tools  jack  a black bra  windshield sunshade  an original 1973 911 large format sales brochure  the original owner's manual and warranty booklet  records for engine work and other parts throughout the restoration  copies of factory parts and service manuals  11 volumes of “Up Fixin” manuals in three ring binders  5 volumes of restoration parts manuals  100+ photos documenting the restoration  and a copy of a 2016 professional appraisal. <br><br>This is a very nice three-owner matching-numbers blue-plate 911S Targa that has always been in Northern California. Restored to high standards and still quite crisp in presentation and operation  this car perfectly embodies the intoxicating appeal of the early 911. It is also exceptionally complete  structurally outstanding  and desirably optioned  making it an excellent choice for the collector or the driving enthusiast.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$145,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Powered by a 3.8L 430hp/325lb-ft Flat-Six that's backed by a 7-Speed PDK Transmission. Original MSRP for this sensational GTS Cabriolet was $149,240 with a long list of desired factory options, consisting of; the aforementioned Carmine Red paint color along with the GTS Interior Package, the previously noted PDK Transmission was electively chosen, along with 18-Way Adaptive Sport Seats Plus with Memory Package, Bose Premium Audio Package, Premium Package, SportDesign Exterior Mirror lower trims in Black, Instrument Dials in Carmine Red, Front &amp; Rear Park Assist, SportDesign Steering Wheel, Luggage Net, Smoking Package. Sitting right in between an 'S' model and a GT3, Porsche decided to try an close the gap a bit and released the GTS. 30 more horsepower and some factory-installed performance upgrades push this car faster, hold it tighter, and make it stand out in any crowd. The GTS is wider, more aggressive, smoother and, overall, an amazing street machine for nearly any kind of driving. This 1-Owner example is outstanding condition throughout.Factory installed upgrades that pertain only to the GTS model of Porsche consist of; GTS Interior Package, 20 Black Wheels, Black Exhaust Tailpipes, Black Headlight Trim, Black Trim Stripes, GTS Badges, Blacked out Adaptive Bi-Xenon Headlamps, Custom Rear Apron, and Sport Exhaust. The wheels and tires are bigger than the S model and so Porsche created the GTS with a standard wide-body kit that made the back end bigger to accommodate the change in the wheel and tire size. Being wider gives the car a lower looking and more aggressive stance compared to previous models.Porsche has done an amazing job with the GTS over the years in creating something unique that it is able to stand out from the other 10+ 911 variants available. In creating the GTS packages, they also left some standard and upgradable features you see on all the other Porsche's to maintain the brand image and make sure their customers know they are in a Porsche. This Porsche has upgraded packages that consist of; Bose Audio Package (Bose Surround Sound System, Online Services, NavWeather and HD Radio, SiriusXM, NavTraffic), Premium Package with Adaptive Sport Seats Plus, Automatically Dimming Interior Mirror, Heated Front Seats, and Sport Chrono Package.Standard features consist of; Convertible Top, Climate Control, Keyless Entry, Leather-Wrapped Steering Wheel, Paddle Shifters, Power Seats, Seat Memory, Bluetooth Connection, Navigation System, Electronic Stability Control, PASM Adaptive Damper System, Power Spoiler, Rain Detecting Variable Intermittent Wipers with Heated Jets, and Body-Colored Power Heated Side Mirrors with Manual Folding.For more information on this fabulous 2016 Porsche Carrera GTS, or any of our 40+ Porsches always in stock, contact one of our friendly and knowledgeable sales consultants or always feel free to drop by our Bellevue, WA Park Place Ltd campus - where we have over 40,000 sq ft of indoor showrooms filled with the finest cars.

The car was very popular with the club sport weekend racers and autocrossers due to the small size, excellent balanced handling, and light weight body. As all air-cooled Porsche values continue to climb the 914 remains a great way to enter the P car family while not breaking the bank. Parts and servicing are relatively inexpensive and the handling will have you grinning ear to ear. </p><p>The 914 on offer was built in February 1972 and was originally sold new to Eve Jolivette at Bob Hagestad Porsche-Audi in Denver, Colorado on April 24th 1972. The original MSRP was $4399.00 with options that included; $3900 base price, $300 appearance group, $83 tinted glass, $18 center arm rest and $98 destination charge. Eve owned the car for 38 years, her name is engraved on a dash plaque that was fitted when the car was new, occasionally she autocrossed it at Bandmere Speedway in Colorado and was often the only women driver associated with the Porsche club in those days. Eve cherished the 914 and kept every single record and made detailed ownership notes, the kind of well documented history most collectors only dream about. Eve had the car refinished in the original Saturn Yellow at a cost of $4472 in December of 1992 and had an engine overhaul at a cost of $3348 in June of 1992 at around 70,000 miles. Eve's granddaughter sold the car in 2010 to a NW auto enthusiast and broker who then found another caring individual to keep it until the current owner a NW Porsche collector, purchased the car in early 2014 and he is technically the 3rd owner. The original owners book, stamped service book, window sticker, original keys, spare tire and jack are all present.  </p><p>This 914 just received a mechanical recommissioning by Authentic Motorcars consisting of a full service including fluids, spark plugs and wires, new fuel injectors, pump, and filter, fresh valve adjustment, new MP sensor, new belts, and a new battery. The shifter bushings and rods were rebuilt, motor mounts replaced, new KYB gas shocks and new rear springs installed as well as a new Sebring performance exhaust. The door seals are new and the targa top seal is in good condition and all electricals function as they should. </p><p>Features include optional PORSCHE side graphics, front driving lamps, leather wrapped steering wheel, center console arm rest cusion, period yellow/black coco floor mats, an original Mohn accesory ski rack, and Fuchs type alloy wheels with Vredstein Sprint Classic tires. The original steel wheels with hub caps also come with the car. The interior is very clean, new carpets were fitted to freshen up the cabin, the original basket weave upholstery adores the seats and door panels, the dash is in great condition showing very little age. The factory optional Blaupunkt am/fm radio, gauges, lights, heater, wipers all function correctly as does the comically annoying seat belt warning buzzer. </p><p>Here is an extremely rare opportunity to acquire a very well documented Porsche 914 that is ready to become a member of your family.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$24,900               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

But when you drop the top, stir that 6-speed manual transmission around, and listen to that race bred motor with the wind in your hair, you will forget about the technology and just enjoy the ride.   <br> <br><br> You have never seen a car quite like this one because this is a one of a kind.  The color, a beautiful Turquoise, is a special order, code L999, ''paint to sample'' from the factory.  The shape is, however, very familiar and unmistakably that of a 911.  Each new version of the car is a logical evolution of the original iconic design.  The headlights are high on the fenders, as they have always been, but new and improved for even greater visibility.  The aerodynamic shape of the car has been refined and proven on the race track.  The distinctive wraparound rear end is still there from the early days, but it has to cover much larger BBS Sport Design wheels, so it gives the whole car a more aggressive stance.  Obviously, what sets this car apart from other 911s is the drop top.  At the touch of a button, the folding top will lower and tuck under its cover in about 15 seconds, easily accomplished at most stop lights.  <br> <br><br> Open the door, have a seat, and you will find all the comforts and conveniences of a modern sports luxury car.  A premium sound system, leather heated seats, power everything, burled wood trim, and a navigation system to help you get where you are going.  If that's the goal.  Because, ''Not all who wander are lost''.   Sometimes they are just enjoying the drive.   There are two unusual features in the interior that stay true to the cars racing heritage.  First, the ignition key was placed to the left side of the steering wheel so that it could be turned as the driver was jumping into the car during a ''Lemans'' racing start.  Second, the tachometer is in the center of the dash because it's definitely the most important gauge during a race.  A surprise feature, especially in a convertible sports car, is a back seat.  Granted, it is more for groceries, coolers, and dogs than people, but it does have seat belts! <br> <br><br> Beneath and behind those back seats is the business end of the car.  A legendary flat 6-cylinder engine provides a low center of gravity for better handling, and makes 300 horse-power to keep the car running with some fast company.  The shift knob of the manual 6 -speed transaxle falls easily to hand, and can be way more fun to drive than the tiptronic transmissions.   Being a Carrera 4 means that the front wheels are driven too.  They work in conjunction with the anti-lock brakes and traction control systems to make the car safer and more stable in virtually all road conditions, including the snow.   The rubber meets the road through 265/35ZR18 tires in the rear, and 225/40/ZR18s in the front.  Porsche has ensured that the technology in the car works seamlessly so that it becomes invisible, and just makes the driver look better. <br> <br><br> All the driver knows, is that they can really feel the road through the steering wheel in this car, and that it's a blast to drive.   Come on down and give it a spin. Call now!</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$24,995               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

More powerful engine choices and a host of different visual design cues was Porsche's way of evolving the look of the 356 that would see its production go onto 1965.</p> <p>This Meissan blue 356 would be produced on July 9th, 1957, and was destined for the U.S., originally optioned with sealed beam headlights, the speedometer in miles and with USA bumpers. It would then be shipped from Germany and imported in Hoffman, New York.</p> <p>In 2005, the 356 would be commissioned to have a full ground up concours restoration by its then owner Charlie Presta. The meticulous 2-year restoration would be carried out by Restoration Works of Chico, California. With a large photo album that shows the restoration, the car was installed on a rotisserie and stripped down to just its steel tub, properly refinished, corrected and repainted in its original Meissan Blue color. The interior received all new upholstery and the gauges were rebuilt. The suspension was completely gone through and the engine was entirely rebuilt, pushed out to 1720cc in the process for extra power. The transmission was also gone through and made sure that each of the 4 gears shifted beautifully.</p> <p>Completed in 2007, the car would then go to a number of shows over the next few years, taking home two ''Best of Show'' and seven ''First in Class'' awards with the stunning 356. Canepa would then acquire the car in 2012. When it arrived at Canepa, the 356 was still in concours condition from adding so few miles since the completion of the restoration. It was then sold to a Northern California owner who took the utmost care in the car. During his 5-year ownership, the car remained in almost undriven condition, adding less than 1,300 miles to the odometer.</p> <p>Upon arriving back at Canepa, the car still looked as though it had just completed its concours restoration. The car was completely serviced and every system was gone through from front to back, making sure that everything was in perfect working condition. It was also subjected to a full ''Canepa Difference'' concours detail. This included hand cleaning the entire underside of the car, engine bay, trunk and interior, making it look as clean as when it rolled out of the Porsche factory. The Meissen blue paint was painstakingly polished to make sure that it shined as if it had just completed its restoration. Mechanically ready to take a cross country tour and cosmetically fit to bring home a best of show, this Porsche 356A will please any and all air-cooled Porsche lovers.</p> <p><b>Show Results</b></p> <p>First Place - Chico Concours d'Elegance (European Exotics), September 2007<br> First Place - Road &amp; Track at Road America Concours d'Elegance, July 2008<br> Best of Show - The Milwaukee Masterpiece Club Day, August 2008<br> Best of Show - Milwaukee Region PCA Concours d'Elegance, August 2008<br> First Place (Class A)  - Milwaukee Region PCA Concours d'Elegance, August 2008<br> Second Place (Class A)  - Milwaukee Region PCA Concours d'Elegance, October 2008<br> First in Class - Chicago Region PCA Concours d'Elegance, June 2009<br> First in Class - The Milwaukee Masterpiece - International Sports &amp; Gran Turismo, August 2009<br> First in Class Porsche - The Milwaukee Masterpiece, August 2010<br> First Place - Class A - 356 Club Southern California - North Meets South, May 2011</p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Electric Sliding Sunroof. Original Books, Tools and Spare Tire. 37,181 Miles</p><p>This incredibly rare and desirable “Sonderwunsche” (Special Wishes) Factory Slant Nose 85′ 930 Turbo was imported to the United States by Scottsdale Porsche &amp; Audi on 12-26-84. Spending most of its early life in the greater Atlanta, Georgia area, the first owner of record is Wally Nissen of San Luis Obispo, Ca who bought the car in 1993 from Classic Auto Sales Inc. in Omaha, Nebraska. Nissen owned and cared for the car for 14 years and in 2007 the current owner purchased the car. At the time of purchase by the current owner the odometer reading was 24,000 miles. </p><p>“SONDERWUNSCHE FLACHBAU” WERK I factory slant noses were made before the official slant nose production option package was initiated by Porsche in 1987. The SONDERWUNSCHE cars were made to order examples for fastidious clients containing multiple customizations processed as “special work orders”. The issue with pre-1987 slant noses is that Porsche did not consider this a factory production model, but rather, it was invoiced as a work order by the Werk I in-house custom workshop in Zuffenhausen, Germany. Consequently these cars do not have a line item on the Kardex (Porsche factory build sheet) signifying that the car is a SONDERWUNSCHE FLACHBAU, translated as “Special Request Flat Construction”. Since the owners rarely kept the original invoices one must look at the body features and the telltale signs of Porsche craftsmanship, engineering, and parts to validate an authentic special wishes slant nose. Given his impeccable Porsche credentials and history dating back to the 1950's with the Porsche Factory and his considerable knowledge of this vehicle in particular, Jack Pfluegler was willing to sign an affidavit testifying to the factory born nature of the features seen on this exceptional highly original 930 Porsche example (the three page document attested to by Pfluegler can be seen in the picture gallery).</p><p>With only 37,181 original miles from new, this Special Wishes Porsche has seen the highest levels of service throughout its history. Over the years the car has been serviced regularly by VPA Auto Repair Inc of San Luis Obispo while owned by Nissen and later handled regularly for the current owner by well known Porsche expert mechanic Jack Pfleugler of San Miguel. When the present owner bought the car, he had Pfleugler go through the engine completely and sort it properly to run to a very high standard. In the last 3 years, Pfluegler replaced the injectors/fuel pumps and also redid the fuel regulator and fuel head for the car along with general servicing over the past decade. The car runs exceptionally well today and is fully serviced. It has new struts, fuel pumps, air regulator and injectors.</p><p>As a very well kept and exceptionally original example, this car has all the hallmarks and desirable features available at the time from new, including most prominently, being 1 of 44 factory slant nose 930 Turbo's produced in 1985. Still in a highly original condition (sans a new set of tires, wheels, new radio) the car presents incredibly well in Garnet Red/S2 over 99 Light Tan Leather Interior. This “Special Wishes” Porsche came stock with and its 930S engine along with a bigger intercooler and SC cams.</p><p>This 1985 “Sonderwunsche” 930 Turbo Porsche comes with a robust service file with records spanning most of the 1990's through to today. It is also accompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity from Porsche North America, Special Wishes Affidavit from factory trained Porsche expert Jack Pfluegler, period photos and hand written ownership correspondence, original books, tools and spare tire.</p><p><strong>805-474-6477 Email: <a data-toggle=""modal"" href=""#myModal"" id=""contact-seller""> [Email Seller] </a></strong></p><p><strong>This and others, visit: <a href=""http://www.ScottGrundfor.com"">http://www.ScottGrundfor.com</a></strong></p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

The car is original Signal Red/6407 body color.</p><p> </p><p>Starting with a sound, numbers matching, early 911 chassis #302023 the car was prepared as a rally car, specifically for the 2011 Targa Newfoundland and this work was trusted to a well respected marque specialist, Automotive Associates of Canton, CT. There was much attention paid throughout this process to make sure that sometime in the future, if required, the car could be brought back to stock without evidence of modification. At the same time this work was done to the highest standard without regard to cost.</p><p> </p><p>In preparation to convert the car for rallying the original engine was removed and a brand new “Best of the Best” 2.4 liter engine installed in its place. The front fenders, hood, rear deck lid and rear fenders were replaced with lightweight fiberglass panels. (the remainder of the car is steel.) All the interior was removed from the car and a full Porsche designed rally roll cage installed along with comfortable competition seating. The complete car weighs in at just 2240 pounds. In addition to the original engine, the car comes with a professionally tuned 2.2 liter rally engine to compete in the Carrera Panamericana. Front and rear suspensions are standard but have been strengthened in order to handle the rigors of a 7 day rally on open roads, which are not always smooth! The results speak for themselves with podium finishes at Targa Newfoundland in 2013 and 2014</p><p> </p><p>In addition to rally prep, a full body shell refinish was incorporated to yield the level of fit and finish that this superb example exhibits. On offer is a highly desirable early example of the Porsche 911 and substantially more. The pedigree of the car, the record of its achievements and a package of spare drive train components to suit various events or exhibit formats.

Options from the factory include; floor mats, Hi-Fi Stereo with cassette player, 17in Cup design wheels with silver finish, full power seat for driver, cruise control, lumbar support for driver and Porsche colored crest in wheels.

It was the maker's top-of-the-range 911 model for its entire production duration and, at the time of its introduction, was the fastest production car available in Germany. Benefiting from Porsche's pioneering turbo technology developed for the 917-10, -30, and the 911 Turbo Carrera RSR 2.1, the 930 was an instant sensation. While the original purpose of the road car was to gain homologation for the 1976 racing season, it promptly became a cult car. Porsche made its first and most significant changes to the 930 for 1978, enlarging the engine to 3.3 litres and adding an air-to-air intercooler. Porsche also upgraded the brakes to units similar to those used on the 917 racecar.For more information on this fabulous 1982 Porsche 911 Turbo Coupe, or any of our 40+ Porsches always in stock, contact one of our friendly and knowledgeable sales consultants or always feel free to drop by our Bellevue, WA Park Place Ltd campus - where we have over 40,000 sq ft of indoor showrooms filled with the finest cars.

European Collectibles has restored hundreds of cars over the years but this particular 356 SC should never have been restored; it was a potential preservation class winner before we did a total nut and bolt restoration. The original owner insisted on having his 356 restored and that is what we did. After stripping the 356 to steel we were amazed, it had never had any damage to the body, never had any rust repair and had never been disassembled. It had spent its entire life in inland California and was in storage for the past 30 years prior to restoration.</p> <p>European Collectibles completely disassembled this 356, stripped the body to steel, did a complete concour repaint its original color (Champagne Yellow), had everything re-chromed, installed new rubber, a complete new German interior and rebuilt the entire driveline including engine, transmission, brakes, and suspension.</p> <p>The thing that sets this car apart from the rest is the quality of the original parts. Normally you take off the original parts and they are needing to be restored but all the original parts looked like NOS (new off the shelf, obsolete original parts), the wiper motor was as brand new, the relays looked like you had just pulled them out of an NOS box, the seat chrome was as it left the factory. All the gauges switches and dash components whereas new. All the original insulation was perfect, untouched &amp; in excellent condition. The wiring harness we usually always replace but the harness was as new. We stripped the undercarriage to steel and the original floors and battery box had zero rust with no damage. All the suspension came out and was rebuilt. All the chrome was redone in triple plate. This is truly a 356SC for the real discerning collector.</p> <p>One of the most desirable collector models is the 356 SC Cabriolet, introduced in September of 1963 for the 1964-year model. It was the best driving 356 built with plenty of horsepower! One of approximately 1,200 built. This 356 features all of the subtle improvements and updated details fitted to the 356 over the 15 years of the production run. 1600cc producing 95 horsepower engine with 741 manual 4-speed transmission and four-wheel disc brakes.</p> <p>Offered with tools, books, boot cover and Certificate of Authenticity from Porsche confirming matching decks, doors and driveline.

Per the records, she continued to service the 912 routinely until the day she sold it to the 2nd owner in Saratoga Springs NY, with 60,973 miles.  The 2nd owner had a pre-purchase inspection (PPI) performed on the 912 and the PPI is in the records along with photos to document the 912 during the valuation in June of 1994.  The records stop from the 2nd owner.  It appears to have been purchased by the 3rd owner from Bayboro NC, in 2007.  The 3rd owner maintained the records on the 912 and did a mild restoration with a photo documentation of the work.  As shown in the photos, the 912 was free of rust or corrosion issues.  It appears to only have had the front battery pan replaced during the restoration.  The 3rd owner did not drive the 912 much during his ownership and sold the 912 to the 4th owner in November of 2012.  The 4th owner has had the 912 since and has shown it in numerous PCA events (winning events as well).   He is a 40-year PCA member and a PCA Zone 3 Concours Judge.  The 912 lived in Panama City FL, until he traded it to us for a 1971 911E.

The Porsche 914 Styling avoided most of the impracticalities of the typical mid-engined layout with good outward vision and two large trunks. Performance was modest at first with base VW-derived engines of 1.7 and 1.8 liters. But the 2.0 Liter cars, like our fine example, gave sparkling performance and are the most desirable of the four-cylinder models today. Handling is superb with fine brakes and phenomenal steering. Bright period colors, like this delightful Yellow, suit the car well. Our car is reported to have been purchased new by an Alaskan oil field worker, who kept the car at his Texas home. It then went to an owner in Pasadena, CA who owned the car for about five years and sold it to its most recent owner. The hood and trunk lids were re-painted, but the paint and interior are otherwise original. It has covered 55k miles in all and is in robust mechanical health.

Its lengthy history extends over 50 years of production and to this day, the iconic design lines are still utilized. Throughout the 911's long life, it has steadily evolved becoming more refined but still maintaining the essence of its roots. The air-cooled era spawned some of Porsche's greatest creations and by 1989, they released what is referred to as the 964 series. The 964 was a milestone in the 911 lineage, as it saw a variety of technologies that were yet to be integrated as standard features in addition to having a new, reengineered chassis. In terms of major cosmetic changes, the 964 received redesigned front and rear bumpers for better aerodynamics and an electronic, self-deploying rear wing for added down force at high speeds. ABS and power steering were made a standard feature for the 964, as well as a 3.6L flat six that propelled the car to 60mph in 5.5 seconds. Porsche did not stop there because one could either choose a rear wheel drive platform in the Carrera 2 or opt for four-wheel drive in the Carrera 4. The 964 was often overlooked by Porsche aficionados until the recent appreciation of air-cooled Porsches which sparked new interest in the once undervalued 964.</p><p>The example on offer is a 1994 Porsche 964 Carrera 4 widebody having traveled 63,200 miles from new. This example wears an expertly executed repaint in the original factory color as well as reupholstered front seats, again finished in its factory colors. According to the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, this example was finished in Midnight Blue Metallic (special order color code F8) over a Light Grey and Cobalt Blue leather interior. It also equipped with a left power seat, cruise control, amplifier system, electric sunroof, CD player, leather covered instrument rings, and rim caps with Porsche crest from the factory. Unfortunately, the history of this example is not fully known but it has been under care of a Porsche collector and enthusiast for the past two years and comes with a clean Carfax. Most importantly, this car is 1 of approximately 267 Carrera 4 widebody cars produced for the North American market. This “turbo look” option package provided all of aesthetic elements of the Turbo, which included larger wheels and widebody along with turbo performance features including brakes and suspension. Essentially, it is a 964 turbo minus the turbo.</p><p>Cosmetically, the car is in excellent condition with superior paint quality being the first thing one will notice. It shows evenly down the lines of the car and has a mirror like shine with no inconsistencies in the finish. The only item that could be improved upon is a proper detail and buffing to remedy some very light surface scratching/swirl marks on the hood and rear fenders. They would only be noticed during a close inspection under the right light and do not require any immediate attention. The panel gaps throughout are spot on, showing as they would from the factory. All of the glass is crisp and free of any common blemishes (scratches, chips, cracks) while the rubber seals and moldings have no dry rot or damage. An examination of the five spoke alloy wheels will conclude that they have been well maintained as the rest of the car has, with no curb rash or flaws to make note of. Typical of the 964 series, the rear tail light lenses have slight sun fading but no cracking.</p><p>Continuing our assessment, the interior is definitely one of the highlight features on this example, not only because of the unique color combination but also the fantastic condition it is in. The front seats are simply impeccable with no notable flaws, presenting like new with the backseats being original and in near perfect condition. This is the story with the remainder of the interior; the door panels, dash, leather wrapped gauges, rugs, and headliner are in excellent condition with no major flaws to note and appear to be original. In addition, the door jams are well kept, having maintained their original paint albeit some small chips/scratches. The electrical components are in complete working order; the window motors are still strong, the interior lighting is functional and the alpine radio is operational. Additionally, both the heat and air-conditioning work properly as do all exterior lights.</p><p>The remarkable condition of this example carries over to the engine bay as it is cleanly, neat, and tidy. All of the surfaces are clean with no serious faults with the original cadmium plated items still in excellent condition. The factory stickers are present and the engine number indicates that this is a matching-numbers example. The front trunk displays much of the same characteristics, having no major blemishes or any evidence of accident history. Factory inspection and torque markings are evident throughout the truck area. The factory spare wheel, jack, tools, and air compressor are all present. Also, unlike 99% of other Porsches from this era, the struts for the front trunk lid are fully functional. The undercarriage is also free of any rusting or major road rash as well as the underside of the engine being very clean for a 23-year-old car.</p><p>This tedious care taken by the current owner has resulted in a well-sorted 964 that runs and drives without any issues. Even when cold, the engine starts with ease and does not smoke. Once up to temperature, this example performs very well. It pulls strong with no strange vibrations or hesitation and the steering is tight and responsive. It tracks straight down the road with fluid shifts and smooth braking. The tires are modern Yokohamas that have approximately 70% of tread life remaining and do not appear to have any cracks or dry rot.</p><p>The Porsche Carrera 4 offers heritage, performance, and iconic 911 styling with a proper air-cooled flat-six to match. This particular example boasts one of the most extravagant color combinations coupled with the desirable widebody configuration, resulting in a rare and attractive pairing. With its exceptional cosmetic and mechanical condition, this car would be an excellent addition to any collection. Offered with the sale are the original books, tools, jack, air-compressor, and Certificate of Authenticity.</p><p>New website coming soon!

The interior is in excellent condition, with little wear on the black leather seats and a clean, crack free dashboard. This car comes with a lot of standard features including power windows, climate control, premium stereo, heated seats, power mirrors, and dual trunks.</p> <p>The standard 2.5l flat six cylinder engine runs very well and sounds good and runs well. With just over 200hp, this is more than enough power for a light sports car. The 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission is a smooth shifter and can even be controlled by the shift paddles on the steering wheel.

A lightened, stripped-down drop top with a few updated styling touches made this car the one you could drive to the track, race around to your hearts content and then drive home afterwards.</p> <p>Destined for American shores, this Speedster was optioned with Sealed-Beam headlights and U.S. bumpers with ivory paint and a red leatherette interior. On December 27th, 1957, the Porsche would arrive with Mr. Hoffman of New York City. Maximilian Hoffman was the most prominent importer of European vehicles on the East Coast and was the main point of entry for most Porsches in the 1950's.</p> <p>The second owner who would keep the car for three decades, Leonard Cummings, the owner of Autosport Engineering in Stow, Massachusetts, would begin restoring the car and paint it. Shortly after, he put the car in storage in 1985 and would remain there for two decades. The Speedster would then see the light of day in 2005 when its new owner, Jordan Bochanis, would purchase the car with the intention of restoring it. Now in possession of the 356, Jordan would take the car to Jim Newton of Automobile Associates of Canton, CT, a renowned restorer of Porsche 356s.</p> <p>The restoration of the 356 would take three years and ensuring that nothing was left to chance and that everything, down to the last nut and bolt, was restored properly. Stripped down to bare metal, it was evident that the car was never in an accident and even went as far as not having any major dents. Each panel was test fitted individually ensuring perfect fitment prior to painting. The original color Ivory was matched to a sprayed sample provided by John Willhoit of Willhoit Auto Restoration based on the original factory formula.</p> <p>With the exterior finished, the engine was the next step for Automobile Associates. Rebuilt with a 1720cc piston and cylinder ''Big Bore'' set from NLA Limited, connection rods were replaced with balanced ''C'' rods, reconditioning the crank, cam replaced with a ''C'' camshaft, and the original ''Super'' carburetors rebuilt and jetted for increased horsepower.</p> <p>The Speedster's interior was completely reupholstered with period-correct materials. The seats were covered in red leatherette, and the Oatmeal carpet and canvas top provided by Autos International. The red vinyl was matched to a well-preserved section of the original vinyl that was in excellent condition, and all gauges restored expertly by North Hollywood Speedometer. A new wiring harness from YnZ was also installed, ensuring that all electrical connections would work just as good as they did from the factory. The tool kit was also cleaned, with the pliers and generator wrench stripped and repainted, while the missing screwdrivers were replaced with custom-made set by Wills Werks.</p> <p>Completed in 2008, Jordan would take the car to its first car show in September, the Fairfield County Concours in Westport, Connecticut. There it would win Porsche Cars North America ''Most Significant Porsche'' award. In 2011, the car would then move onto its new owner, who would own the car for 7 years.</p> <p>Upon arriving at Canepa, the car presents in a stunning fashion that only true concours cars can. Visually stunning and mechanically sound, the 356 Speedster is the result of a restoration that is meticulously done. Needing only a light hand cleaning of the interior, engine, trunk and underside, the car now presents as if it just left the Porsche factory in Germany. With a concours-level cosmetic and mechanical restoration, paired with its matching numbers components and staggering period-correct condition, this Porsche Speedster is ready for any drive onto any show lawn.</p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

I can no longer justify keeping it ( my wife can no longer get in or out of it with her arthritis ). The leather seats still smell the same as the day I bought it. EVERYTHING  WORKS. I can't sit in most sport cars because my head hits the ceiling. I don't have that problem with this one. The inside height is pretty good - better  than normal.The battery and tires are relativity new. The crimson red color is very unusual, the German name for it is Melvinrot.This does not look like a 30 year old car, it looks much newer. It has a large roof opening that electrically pivots at the front and opens at the rear for good quiet ventilation. The windows are electric. It has a five speed stick shift ( the clutch has been replaced with a heavy duty one ). I had the security system unplugged - I don't need it. The timing belt is up to date. This is a fun car to drive - it corners very well. The flip up lights have never been a problem like with some other sports cars. I have a black bra for this car. It has the original Blaupunkt radio with a casette tape player but I had the speakers replaced with good ones. This car has been well maintained and I have the papers to prove it.

As it was not sold in the U.S. due to the extremely aggressive tuning, very few original European-specification cars made it into the States.</p> <p>Chassis number 490667 is one of those rare cars, recently imported this year to North America. Like all Type 964 RSs, this car is equipped with the M64/03 engine – a revised version of the standard 3.6-liter flat-six, which produces 260 bhp. The lightweight Carrera RS was created by stripping out the interior of needless creature comforts; owners had to option back in power windows, rear seats, stereos, and air conditioning, if desired. With a seam-welded chassis, a hood made of aluminum, and magnesium wheels, even more weight was decreased. In total, the Carrera RS is approximately 345 pounds lighter than the Carrera 2 model upon which is it based.</p> <p>As it was prepared for the Japanese market, the Certificate of Authenticity for chassis 490667 notes that it was originally fitted with specific equipment for Japan. Also ordered with limited-slip differential from new, additional features included five-speed transmission, bucket seats, 17-inch Cup wheels, and Yokohama tires. Finished in the original colors of Polar Silver Metallic over Black/Grey Leatherette with leather seats, this Carrera RS remains in excellent condition inside and out. Recently the undercarriage, paint, interior, and even suspension has been meticulously detailed by Canepa Design to ensure that this stunning Carrera RS is absolutely spotless throughout.</p> <p>Offered is a chance to own one of the rare original Carrera RSs not originally available in the North American market – one of the most sought-after modern normally aspirated 911s.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$309,950               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

The L stood for ''Late'' (as in late model), and was the most expensive of the 911s, since the 911S was not available in the US for 1968. Only 449 cars were built with this designation and production dates after October 1967.</p> <p>This particular example, 3280588 was completed on March 1st 1968 in Silver (6851) over Black Leather (B) upholstery, fitted with a substantial selection of special optioned equipment such as: US equipment, exterior mirror, spare parts kit, rear window wiper, antenna, loudspeaker, engine noise suppression, 2 headrests – leather, tinted glass – all around, 100 liter gas tank, Recaro sport seats – leather, halogen fog lights, halogen spot light and Dunlop tires. Extraordinary to say the least. This very special 911 was purchased by Mr. H.K. Mills of Pontiac, Michigan, through Jabsen Motors of Hong Kong, famed for their introduction of Porsche to Asia in 1955. The Porsche Kardex for 3280588 states the 911 received multiple services from August to December 1968, starting with Scania-Vabis in Sweden to later repairs performed in Stuttgart. The 911 eventually made its way home to Michigan, U.S.A., where it would reside for the remainder of its life. After what we can only presume was an exciting life lived, the car was tucked away in garage storage for many years, until its recent discover in Michigan.</p> <p>Presented as found, 3280588 offers an amazing opportunity for its next caretaker to restore back to former glory and delivery presentation. In addition to the abundance of factory installed equipment, the L would also receive a Golde manual sunroof and air conditioning, while retaining many of its original components.

New floor pans, diagonal, longitudinals, battery box floor.</strong></p><p>This Twin Grille Roadster was purchased by Jim Kellogg in early 1983 from Larry Scoglund of Minneapolis. Larry was a vintage racer and bought this as a project/race car. He had found it in a barn in Wisconsin. Jim Kellogg restored this car especially for his wife who enjoyed the car until it was recently sold. The Twin Grille Roadster was complete with the original engine but was tired and needed a restoration. The Roadster was completely disassembled and as media blasting was not available at that time, the 356 was acid dipped. The acid removed fiberglass that had been used for repairs and removed rust damage. Metal repair was done using mostly NOS panels which were available at that time. Effort was made to duplicate the factory welds. The Roadster was moved from Minnesota to Colorado in 1985. It had been assembled to verify panel correctness but needed paint and interior. The Roadster was painted its original Ruby Red by Tom Conway of Carquip in Boulder, Colorado. The interior was purchased from Autos International in California and installed by an experienced upholstery shop. The engine was rebuilt by Ron Appleton in Boulder, Colorado. The restored Twin Grille Roadster made its first appearance at the 356 Registry West Coast Holiday in Steamboat Springs, Colorado in 1991. Since then it has been driven to 356 Registry Holidays in Lake Tahoe, California, Sedona, Arizona and Boerne, Texas. It has participated in many Rocky Mountain Porsche 356 Club events over the years and has won Concours awards. </p><p>The 1962 Roadster is a unique Porsche 356. It was built by the well-known Belgium coachbuilder DIteren. 2653 Roadsters were built in 1960 and 1961 but only 249 in 1962. 1962 was the year the rear deck lid was changed from a single grille to a double grille to obtain more air for more powerful engines. Thus, the terminology Twin Grille Roadster. Unique features of the DIteren Roadsters besides the twin grille and aluminum windshield frame on this 356, includes a special fuse cover, chassis numbered fuel filler door and doors numbered on the bottom. DIteren also used a caulk on all seams; the other coach builders did not. This caulk was still pliable during disassembly and had saved many panels from rust. The caulk was duplicated during restoration. The restoration of Twin Grille Roaster 89621 and other 356 restorations led to Jim Kelloggs book Porsche 356 Guide to Do-It-Yourself Restoration which has sold over 4,000 copies and is used by both professional and amateur restorers. <br> </p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Speedsters included a revised windshield that significantly lowered the look of the car. A chrome strip down the side of the car was also added and gone were unnecessary items such as an effective top. Instrumentation had been reworked to have only three dials.

An early chassis with a later engine, as the 356A Coupes and Cabriolets were already in production. Porsche Service Bulletin 1/56 announced the 356A Speedster, starting with chassis number 82000 (officially Typ 644 began with car 82001). It also states from 80856 onward, 1600 engines would be installed in the Pre-A chassis and sold as a 1956 model. According to Heinrich's ""Porsche Speedster Typ 540"" book, the last 356 Pre-A speedster was 81234.</p><p>Believed to have sent much of its life along the upper east coast, this Speedster currently displays a matured, but well cared for older restoration and benefits from a recent 2017 mechanical tune-up to all systems. This included new brake master cylinder, lines, hoses, wheels cylinders and shoes, new Koni shocks, clutch, flywheel and throwout bearing, motor and transmission mounts, all new ignition and fuel delivery components, rebuilt carburetors, heater equipment, shift and steering components, all fluids and filters, aluminum drum covers, along with all 5 wheels shod with fresh powedercoat, Firestone Deluxe Champion tires and concours correct valve retainers, caps and lug nuts.</p><p>Both front and rear compartments present very honestly as a driver's car, as does the Speedster floor pans. The 356 retains its original (144) stamped decklid and bonnet. Years ago, its original motor – no. 80057 was replaced with the current unit a type 1600 engine from 1959. All four wheels are date stamped 59. While the original matching transmission no. 7515 remains in place. In addition to its rarity, 81144 comes fitted with an authentic Glaspar Hardtop, which have been prized from their inception for improved visibility and weather protection. Some of these tops even made their way to the Porsche factory for testing and examination. A fully restored and body number matched soft top accompanies, along with side curtains.</p><p>Now offered for Worldwide purchase and delivery from our Houston, Texas showroom, this exceptionally special 356 is ready for immediate vintage touring enjoyment.

With the all new 911SC coming to market, it was a significant improvement over it processor. With an upgraded 3.0L that proved to be very dependable and stronger for the additional weight that was added to add some extra creature comforts for the driver and passengers.

They both received turbo wings and more aggressive styling. The core differentiators between the two models was that the C4S was equipped with a naturally aspirated, 3.6L, air-cooled, flat-six-cylinder engine which served as the base for the bi-turbocharged variant that the Turbos received. The C4S was also engineered with a four-wheel-drive chassis (hence the “4” in the model designation) while the 993 Turbos were all rear-wheel-drive. The C4 “S” variant also implemented a lower ride height and more robust suspension. These cars offer one of the last, most authentic, and refined air-cooled 911 driving experiences before Porsche entered the water-cooled era.</p><p>On offer is a 1996 Porsche Carrera 4S coupe, chassis number WP0AA2996TS322892, original engine number 64T04702, having traveled approximately 61,000 miles from new. The Porsche Certificate of Authenticity confirms this example remains finished in its desirable, factory assigned color combination (Polar Silver Metallic “A8” exterior, Classic Grey interior). This is an extremely rare specification C4S that is thoroughly equipped with a series of exclusive options. One will immediately notice the front and rear factory Aerokit Turbo II spoilers giving the illusion that this C4S is a Turbo.</p><p>Entering the cabin, one will find many more unique and desirable options. This example is also equipped with painted hard-back electric sport seats and carbon/aluminum shifter and brake handle. Other options include rear wiper, 4 rim caps with Porsche crest, HiFi sound system, AM/FM radio with cassette player, and 6-disc remote CD changer.</p><p>The paint on this C4S would fall in the category of “very nice driver quality.” It remains in its original color and presents handsomely, lacking any significant blemishes. The faults that one would notice during a close inspection all fall in the realm of what one would expect with a 61k mile example. Localized on the front nose, bumper, and lower lip area are a series of stone chips, minor-light scratches, and mild marks of use but nothing of a severity that would warrant immediate refinishing. On the rear spoiler is about a 4” hairline crack in the paint due to flexing/vibrations during road use. The body of this C4S has a consistent finish from panel to panel, also possessing a nice shine.</p><p>Looking over the glass, rubber components, and exterior trim items, everything presents in tandem with an example with similar mileage or better in many respects. The painted wheels have incurred no severe curb rash with the worst blemish being a peanut size paint chip at the edge of the passenger front wheel. The tires have ample tread life left and no cracking or dry rot.</p><p>The interior of this example shows beautifully- the painted hard back sports seats having faired very well over the years. There is no significant bolster wear, inconsistencies in the finish or damage to the original leather. The leather wrapped door panels, dash, rear bulkhead, and center console all present phenomenally and have no notable inconsistencies. Glancing down at the grey rugs, they have clearly been well-kept and the rear seats, as with most air-cooled Porsches, look almost new as they have seen little to no use. The electric window switches, gauges, knobs, and related systems all functional without fault. In short, the cabin of this example is cosmetically superior, especially when considering the miles.</p><p>The front boot is a gold mine of factory markings, original stickers, and factory stampings. There is simply nothing one could justifiably fault in regard to this area. Moving to the engine bay, from what is visible we can again see many factory stickers and markings on bolt heads. All related engine componentry appears like new and it is obvious this example saw very regular maintenance executed by capable technicians.</p><p>Our specialists at LBI Limited are extremely astute in this era of air-cooled Porsches in all facets and based on a test drive as well as an extremely detailed visual inspection, we have concluded this C4S is mechanically excellent. Upon initial start-up, even after being in storage for a few weeks, the engine comes to life almost instantaneously and does not excessively smoke. The engine does not appear to have any notable oil leaks, a common fault with these Porsches, and performs without missing a beat during spirited drives. The steering feels tight and lacks any excess play with the brakes quickly knocking off speed without pulling, squeaking, or fading.</p><p>The 6-speed gearbox operates without fault and the linkage lacking any serious play in the bushings making gear-changes effortless. The clutch does not have any symptoms that indicate the need for replacement or adjustment. This example is ready to be driven and enjoyed on a casual drive around town or put through the gears on a Sunday morning on your favorite back-road.</p><p>The 1996 Porsche C4S on offer is an extensively optioned, well-kept, factory correct, example that is ready to move onto its next custodian. Given that this example's well-kept driver quality cosmetic presentation, mechanical integrity, and the miles on the odometer, it makes it the perfect C4S to drive rather than induct into ownership as a sparingly used garage queen. The value in this C4S lies not only in its elite cosmetic/mechanical condition per the miles and rare factory configuration, but also in the reality that this is an example for the enthusiast that intends to consistently use his/her cars. Included in the sale is the window sticker, manuals, tool kit, Certificate of Authenticity and air-compressor.</p><p>Please visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

This model was ordered from the factory as ''sunroof delete'' by its original owner–an extremely rare feature for this model year. An electric sunroof was part of the Turbo package during this time, but for someone who was more interested in high-performance racing, excluding the electric sunroof was advantageous because it reduced weight and stiffened the body.</p> <p>A few of the amenities of this 930 include sports seats and a beautiful black exterior that is reinforced by a sensational black interior.

This model includes a brand new handcrafted leather interior and convertible top.</p> <p>Our '65 356 is a turn-key, investment-grade vehicle that is ready to be showcased in the world's elite Concours. It was recently recognized by FlatSix.com as one of their favorite 20 Porsches from Monterey 2016. It received a podium finish at Werks Reunion in 2016 and it was the recipient of the Palmetto Award at Hilton Head Island Concours d'Elegance 2016. This year, it was awarded best in its class, 356 Open, at Amelia Island.</p> <p>The year of 1965 was the final year of production for the 356 model because Porsche was introducing the US market to its successor: the 911. Porsche continued to sell the 356 C as demand for the model was extreme in the early days compared to the heavier and more ''civilized'' 911.</p> <p>Our 356 is the ONLY Continental Orange Cabriolet produced for the 1965 model year. It comes dressed in its striking orange exterior with a stunning black leather configuration.</p> <p>No expense was spared in the restoration and every effort was made to preserve as many of the original components (down to nuts, bolts, etc.) versus replacing them with new 'off-the-shelf' parts. Many of the original components including the wheels were professionally re-chromed and are absolutely stunning. The black leather interior is brand new and was completed by one of the best in the business.</p> <p>To put it simply, this car is flawless, this car is exceptional, and this car is waiting to take you on the ride of your life.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$375,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Which is good, because it's also a blast to drive.<br> <br><br> The 944 Turbo S continued Porsche's tradition of building serious driver's cars. The ''S'' model was a rare upgrade for the 1988 model year, and so that's why you're looking at such a cherished example.  The factory-correct Silver Metallic Rose was given a professional respray in 2014 to keep this distinct hue looking its best.  In fact, a great color always has extra merit on a 944 Turbo because of its updated styling w/integrated bumper. The practical side of this front fascia carries large fog lamps and extra cooling ducts.  Fit and finish are typically Porsche excellent and even the black rubber trim like the rear spoiler and weather stripping is smooth and supple. And because this is the top of the 944 line, Porsche also upgraded the Turbo S with a distinctive set of 16-inch Club Sport wheels.<br> <br><br> Not only do we like how distinct the exterior color is, but also the hint of red really looks great against the burgundy plaid interior.   The tartan pattern is part of a great performance tradition at Porsche, and so it offers extra distinction to the Turbo S.  And with so few miles on this coupe, it remains fantastically well-preserved today.  A limited edition also means a loaded vehicle.  You get air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power seats, sunroof, cruise control, and the correct Blaupunkt AM/FM/cassette stereo. There's even modern safety with anti-lock brakes and dual front airbags.  In fact, the only piece that we can find that's not from the factory is a well-integrated K90 radar detector system.  That's just another reminder that Porsche builds performance machines.  That's why the steering wheel has the perfect grip; the tach is large and prominent; and the gearstick just seems to be located in the perfect position for your right hand.<br> <br><br> What makes the S model so special is this is when Porsche fitted a larger turbocharger to the motor.  That means you could get 247 horsepower from just 2.5 liters. The lightweight nature makes these cars a little pocket-rocket.  Plus, it was engineered to be a terrific handling machine with the motor canted over at an angle for a lower center of gravity, and the rear-mounted five-speed transmission means that the car has almost ideal 50/50 weight distribution. Plus, the Turbo S fully independent suspension received upgrades from its 928 big brother.  Add in features like four-wheel disc brakes, power steering, and Porsche's legendary engineering prowess, and you realize this is blast to drive anytime.  <br> <br><br> The sale comes with all the right paperwork, including the owner's manual packet, maintenance records folder, title documentation, and a reproduction window sticker. And because this one-owner car has always been babied (even the clutch and flywheel were replaced in 2015) is more proof that the car has led an easy life as a fair-weather toy.  So if you're a true connoisseur this pampered Porsche is ready right now.

Being one of the earliest of its kind produced, finding an original engine on one of these early classics is quite unique.  The original engine runs very strong with a 5-speed manual gearbox and four-wheel disc brakes. Four-hole front horn grills and non-adjustable front suspension. Displays a beautiful color combination finished in Light Blue with Beige Interior, with the paint still in beautiful condition. The undercarriage has been fully detailed including the floor pans, front suspension pan, and all the suspension components. Truly an extraordinary 912 which is becoming very hard to find!</p> <p>To preserve the original engine of this vehicle, it was sent to a well-known mechanic, Harry Pellow, who was known as the ''maestro'' of Porsche engines. Mr. Pellow, refurbished the engine in late 1988. The beige interior of the vehicle has been completely reupholstered by Auto's International in Solano Beach, CA. Highlights of the restoration include; completely redone blue German square weave carpets, beige front seats, and dash top.<br> History</p> <p>It is impossible to pinpoint when the 1965 912 model year ended and when the 1966 912 model year began.  In 1965 operations at Porsche were such that any given supply of parts would be used until exhausted, and then replacements would sometimes be updated, but such changes did not strictly occur in accordance with each changing model year.   Complicating matters further is that bodies for 912s were made both at the Porsche factory, and by subcontractor Karmann, thus allowing for a scenario where later cars with earlier features could be built at one facility, while earlier cars with later features could be built at the other. Confusing matters even further, is that because 1965 912s were only sold in Europe, most of the first 912s to arrive in the U.S. came via Porsche's European delivery program, whereby U.S. citizens could take delivery of new 912 at the Porsche factory, drive it through Europe for a few weeks, and then import it to the U.S. as a used car at a tremendous tax savings compared to a new car.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$74,500               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Someone once wrote that the Porsche 911 is a ”terrible design, brilliantly executed.” And that pretty much explains why no other automaker is currently offering a rear-engine car. But more than four decades of research and development have morphed the 911 from a mostly entertaining but bedeviling-at-the-limit beast to a very capable and forgiving sports car. It simultaneously provides supercar performance and handling, along with daily driver comfort and livability. The car’s basic design, with its large glass area, slim roof pillars and no-nonsense interior, has hardly changed since its debut in 1964. The driver-centric Porsche 911 interior features a single-pod gauge cluster and supportive bucket seats that feature firm side bolsters that hold you in place during aggressive cornering, yet don’t make you feel constrained.

Many collectors prefer the 1967 model since it was the first year for the S and features the original short wheelbase design and high revving 2.0 liter motor. This car is the highest performance variant of the first 911 in its purest early form, as it was originally conceived and engineered. Good examples of the 67 911S seem to be the hardest to find of all the early cars. <br><br>This car wears its original color of Polo red over a fresh and correct Black tex interior. According to the Certificate of Authenticity, this matching numbers example is an early production car with its build date of November 1966. The car also features the unique Webasto gas heater as fitted from the factory per COA. It has been restored both mechanically and cosmetically and has been recently serviced. This is a wonderful example of an early S- it looks, runs, drives and stops as it should. The 5 speed gearbox shifts smoothly, the engine pulls quickly to redline, and the correct fuchs wheels and correct size tire add to the nostalgic aura. The light and precise steering and nimble handling for which Porsches are known originated here. The car comes with a tool kit, jack, owners manual and Certificate of Authenticity.

Production began in 1948 and lasted until 1965, it featured a lightweight body and an air-cooled engine that was mounted behind the rear axle.  This recipe was responsible for much of Porsches early success in motorsport and was carried through to its predecessor the 911. One of the most famous iterations of the 356 was the ‘Speedster' which was designed specifically for Western markets on the advice of the sole US importer of the time, Max Hoffman.  The goal with the Speedster was to improve performance and lower its price by simplifying and thus lightning the car. Its spartan design met with mixed reviews, people either loved how it drove or disliked the lack of creature comforts so with declining sales in the U.S. Speedster production was ended after a 4 year run.  In 1958, acting on that customer feedback, Porsche introduced the 356 A Convertible D. It was designed to appease the foreign markets that were tired of the bare bones, less is more mentality. This more luxurious model was mechanically identical to the Speedster, all changes were centered around comfort and weather proofing. It featured a taller windscreen with straight sides, allowing better sealing with the side windows and more headroom for normal sized drivers who had problems using the Speedster with the top up. It had conventional roll up windows instead of the side curtains, the much more comfortable coupe-style seats, door pockets with locking flaps, and a larger rear window.  </strong></p><p><strong>Nearly all D's were fitted with the 60-horsepower Type 616/1 engine and had a curb weight of less than 2,000 pounds. The Convertible D could reach 60 mph in a little more than 14 seconds in Normal form, and it was capable of topping 100 mph. Handling was very good compared to other sports cars of the period and the large four-wheel drum brakes were more than adequate.</strong></p><p><strong>Because increasing production of the 356 was putting a strain on existing facilities at Reutter, Porsche contracted the production of this new car to the coachbuilder Drauz at Heilbronn, hence the D. Only 1,330 Convertible D's were built between August 1958 and September 1959 making it the rarest production Porsche 356 model ever manufactured for a full year and extremely sought after by enthusiasts and collectors.  </strong></p><p><strong>This particular Convertible D had the same owner for 40+ years. He kept the car in Kentucky for nearly all of that time and treated the car to a full restoration late in his ownership.  After the restoration was finished he took the car to local Concours events and won a few during that period. The vehicle still presents extremely well today. The body and paint are very clean, the top is like new, and all of the bright work is in excellent condition.  Mechanically it is very well sorted, the engine, engine bay and underside still look like they are fresh out the shop. The engine feels like the compression is very strong, the Solex carburetors were rebuilt just before being offered for sale and it runs beautifully. The clutch feels like it has lots of life left and the transmission is operating perfectly. Before being offered for sale it was inspected and had a service fresh performed so it'd be 100% ready for its next owner to take possession.</strong></p><p> </p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$199,900               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

This gave the 912 the same interior that the 911 enjoyed.

The 1974 U.S. Department of Transportation impact laws presented a difficult challenge to automakers  most of whom struggled to develop an attractive solution to the new 5 mph impact requirements. Porsche's approach was among the neatest of any automaker  and in typical Porsche fashion  what began as a functional requirement became an iconic part of the Porsche aesthetic. From 1974 to 1989  the accordion or impact bumper cars represented the latest evolution of the Porsche 911. While aesthetically similar  the different iterations of impact bumper cars were mechanically quite different.<br><br>The 911 was slated to be replaced by the 928 in the late 70s  a plan that was famously reversed in 1981 by Porsche's then new CEO Peter Schutz  who instructed Porsche's engineers to continue to develop the 911 beyond the already competent SC. The result was the Carrera 3.2  introduced for the 1984 model year  and itself developed over the course of its six model years of production. The engine displacement was increased to 3.2 liters  oil-fed chain tensioners  added  and larger brakes were fitted as well. The definitive version of the Carrera 3.2 was produced from 1987 to 1989  featuring the all-new Getrag G50 transmission  hydraulic clutch  and a modest power increase. Torsion bar suspension and unassisted steering remained  keeping the fundamental 911 architecture intact and making this the last of the original style 911s.<br><br>This particular car must be among the lowest mileage 911 Carreras available. Showing 7 700 miles on the odometer  and supported by the Carfax  this Porsche represents a near new car in every respect. The original owner purchased the car with special order paint “Cassis Red Metallic” with burgundy leather interior  sunroof  and sport seats. The car had two long-term owners in Hawaii  before making its way to the mainland in 2017. Throughout the years  the car has never been damaged  has never been apart  and remains today essentially as new. Recent service includes the replacement of the fuel pump  a new fuel sending unit  and new alternator. The car also has been fully serviced including all fluids  new Continental tires  new locking lug nuts  a new sunroof assembly and seal  new motor mount  new hood struts  and detailing for the engine compartment. An inoperative odometer was also rectified  with the owner noting that the car was only driven to the shop for repairs when the odometer stopped and that the mileage is therefore very close to the indicated mileage. The car is well optioned  with sport seats  Blaupunkt Reno radio  forged Fuchs alloy wheels  Bilstein sport shock absorbers  hi-fi sound system  sunroof  and California emissions.<br><br>Cosmetically  the car presents beautifully. The Cassis Red Metallic paint is stunning  changing intensity of hue from the midday rose color to a sun-setting rich  lustrous violet. Long derided  this color has enjoyed a recent resurgence in interest and popularity  and is now regarded by enthusiasts as a welcome alternative to ubiquitous colors like black and guards red. The paint on this car is essentially as new with factory gloss  wonderful finish  and beautiful detailing around all glass  lenses  and black trim areas. There are a handful of small marks on the paint  including a scratch on the driver's door  but overall the paint is excellent and displays no evidence of paintwork ever. The paint has been metered and displayed consistent and thin readings  exactly the way an original paint Porsche should meter. The glass is original and in excellent condition. The lighting  lenses  and emblems are all in beautiful condition  showing little to no signs of age or wear. The doors  hood  and trunk show consistent panel gaps and proper fitting  all of which shut with factory precision just as they did on the showroom floor. <br><br>The interior is in excellent original condition. The leather on the sport seats remains supple with firm bolsters and consistent sheen and essentially no wear. The original carpeting is in very nice condition owing largely to a complete set of original floor mats (included with the car)  which protected the original carpets and show mild use. The dashboard and door cap leather is exceptionally nice  with all gauges and switches essentially as new and nicely detailed. The red lens for the handbrake and brake pad wear light is missing but the interior is otherwise difficult to fault. The headliner  sun visors  rear seats  rear interior panels  and remaining interior trim are all in excellent condition. The Blaupunkt Reno radio is still in place as well. The overall condition and integrity of the interior supports the low indicated mileage and exceptional care this car has received over the past 30 years. <br><br>The engine compartment is extremely clean and has not been restored. Showing just slight hints of use  the entire engine compartment is undisturbed and unmodified. The trunk is also pleasingly original  showing no aging  with all structural elements beneath the carpets appearing factory fresh. Underneath the car further supports the low miles revealing a dry and clean chassis  with factory Cosmoline coating still in place.<br><br>The car runs and drives as one would expect for such a low mileage undisturbed car. The engine runs well  performing essentially as new  aside from the typical Motronic idle hunting at times. The clutch engages smoothly and positively and the gearbox has good synchromesh. The steering retains the magical light and nimble 911 feel thanks to the 6-inch front wheels  while the chassis and suspension are tight and reassuring. Nestled in the sport seats  sunroof opened  and the open road ahead  there is little that can compare with the engaging sounds of a Carrera 3.2 as it opens up and reveals decades of history and performance heritage behind the Porsche name. This Carrera 3.2 is sold with the original tool roll  jack  and a handful of records for recent work. <br><br>This is an extraordinarily rare opportunity to acquire an exceptional example of the ultimate torsion-bar impact bumper 911. A G50 coupe in an unusual color combination with sport seats  this car is among the cleanest  most undisturbed examples currently available and will appeal to the collector looking for something truly different.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$99,500               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

By the early 1960s, the car was becoming rather antiquated and the pushrod four cylinder engine was at the end of its development life.<br> <br>Under the internal type number 901, Porsche developed a completely new GT car that was and evolution of the 356 but with better visibility, more shoulder room and an overhead cam 2.0 liter flat six-cylinder motor with about 40 more horsepower than a 356 Super.  Early 911s had much of the vintage charm of a 356, including chrome trim inside and out.<br> <br>The 911L was the most expensive 911 offered for the American market in 1968, and since the 911S did not comply with emissions regulations at the time, this was Porsche's solution.  The 911L is essentially a base 911 featuring the 130 hp 2.0-liter Weber carbureted engine, but came standard with the superior 911S suspension and brakes—only 449 L models were made in 1968, making this “regulations to marketing” anomaly model both rare and unique.<br> <br>Understood to have had only three-owners from new, this 911's third owner was a well-known and respected New Jersey Porsche collector.  Having no rust and always having been a cared for 911, in this ownership and approximately eight years ago, this 911 was treated to a comprehensive restoration by New Jersey Porsche specialist Gene Kirschner, Auto Haus who performed all mechanicals with Tuxedo Motorsports performing the cosmetics. Due to this 911's excellent condition prior to restoration, it was decided to keep its superb originality wherever possible. Other than the driver and passenger seats having been recovered, the remainder of the interior is original and absolutely excellent in every way.<br> <br>This 911 is 100% correct as per its Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, it is matching numbers and complete with correct and original tools and manual.

It comes with an extensive array of maintenance receipts to prove the great care it's received over the decades, as well as build receipts and a Certificate of Authenticity to document its genuine Porsche lineage.<br> <br> It may carry a design that's coming up on 50 years old now, but when it comes to automotive design, some looks just age better than others, with this compact German roadster being one of them. Dressed in Phoenix red, it exudes the promise of fun times behind the wheel and arrives at the present day looking great - no doubt the product of a sheltered existence during its lifetime, combined with attentive maintenance. The bright shade is in very nice shape with an even shine all over that's contrasted by the fresh black rubber on its front and rear bumpers. Its low-profile hints at its road hugging prowess and you can't help but notice its unfailingly straight alignment - there are no protruding body panels anywhere you look. Also featuring clean chrome trim around very clear window glass, the visual signs are everywhere that this is one vintage vehicle very ready to hit the road without hesitation. With the flip of a switch, you can also see that the hidden headlights up front raise into place without a hitch. Its Targa top configuration allows you to transition from open air motoring to a more sheltered experience quickly and easily.<br> <br> The 89,000 miles this Porsche has logged over its lifetime constitutes pretty light usage for a car nearly 45 years old, and the fresh-looking interior has been a beneficiary. Open the door to look inside and you won't see a whole lot of evidence of wear - there are no deep creases in the black vinyl bucket seats, and you'd be hard-pressed to find so much as an errant heel mark on the fresh looking carpeting underneath. Up front, the dash area features a textured look that could very well be seen as a forefather to the carbon fiber applications we see today, and carries a trio of very readable gauges in its stock cluster that are joined by another trio vertically mounted within easy view just in front of the floor shifter. The 914's mid- engine configuration not only yields benefits as far as handling is concerned, but also affords this compact car fairly generous storage space in both the front and back, so no worries about bringing your suitcase when you decide to get away for the weekend. A straight and unmarred black pad sits over the top of the dash, and you'll find the original AM/FM radio residing in the center.<br> <br> With its 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine sitting just behind the passenger cabin, this 914 has a weight distribution that, combined with its low center of gravity, allows it to carve corners with ease. The easy-revving powerplant has been well-looked after over the years - with the paperwork backup to prove it - and is in fine operating form. It's paired with a 5-speed manual transmission that shifts easily and securely to make for an involving and thoroughly enjoyable driving experience. This German fun machine sits with its characteristically low-profile stance on a set of 15'' Fuchs forged alloy wheels, wrapped with Yokohama YK520 tires.<br> <br> Looking to take to the road for some open-air excitement at the wheel of a classic roadster with timeless good looks?

With V8 power and an ideal weight distribution, this the affordable head-turner that's also a blast to drive.<br> <br><br> The 928 has aged gracefully as it has become a classic in its own right.  Smooth and purposeful, it still generates a ton of attention out on the road.  While this nearly 40-year-old isn't perfect, it still crisply carries all the distinctive elements that was on so many bedroom walls growing up.  After all, every time you raise the flush-mounted headlights, people instantly take notice.  More than just vintage charm, the recent addition of modern 17-inch Sport Edition wheels means this classic Porsche also has a very modern flair.<br> <br><br> Typical Porsche focus on the driver dominates the interior, with comfortable tan leather buckets and a perfect driving position. In fact, all four seats are buckets to provide the best individual comfort.  The carpets, door panels, and dash are all coordinating to give this a very attractive two-tone tan.  As a true grand touring Porsche, this comes loaded with features like power windows, power seats, power locks, cruise control, an upgraded Panasonic AM/FM/CD stereo, and provisions for air conditioning. You'll love sitting behind the classic Porsche four-spoke wheel and watching the full gauge pack do its dance and you dig into the deep tones of the motor. <br> <br><br> Under the hood is the proper 4.5-liter motor. The overhead cam V8 provides the best of both worlds as it has muscle car-like low-end torque, yet shrieks to redline like an exotic when you prod of the accelerator.  The exhaust note is truly a symphony for the ears that you control all with your right foot.  The transxale setup makes for a wonderfully balanced feeling on the road, and that's exactly where this car belongs.  It has so many great driving features, including a fully independent sports suspension, Mercedes-developed three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and four-wheel disc brakes.  There has even been a recent investment in Riken Raptor ZR tires for modern grip.<br> <br><br> The sale come complete with owner's manual and maintenance records.

The 928 produced from 1978 to 1995 was originally intended to be Porsche""??s flagship model over the 911. The thought was to combine the high performance of a sports car with the refinement of a luxury sedan in a market where regulations were becoming increasingly stringent. Interestingly the 928 was the only V8 powered coupe ever produced by Porsche making for a very special car. Additionally 1991 was the last year for the 928 S4 and only 263 examples we made for the US this year.This numbers matching 928 S4 is powered by a 5.0L V8 that is estimated about 316hp from the factory. This is mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. This engine packs quite a punch and the transmission shifts smoothly. The ride in this grand tourer is sporty enough for the most discerning driver yet sophisticated enough for the pickiest of passengers. The 928 S4 has remarkable handling and cornering capabilities.This sports coupe is in excellent condition thanks to the meticulous maintenance work the current owner has had performed. Some of the work recently performed includes all new belts new oxygen sensor new exhaust manifold gasket new tires updated power steering hose a new dash air conditioning vacuum valves replaced transmission fluid flush radiator flush and differential fluid flush. This does not include a long list of items that were performed prior to late 2016 which includes a new timing belt and water pump.This Porsche presents itself beautifully and you can tell that someone went through the car with a fine-tooth comb. The interior of this 928 looks impeccable. It is well sorted and extremely clean. The exterior of this white Porsche shows very well. The highly desirable white on blue color combination works perfectly on this car.

The original Porsche 356 Speedster of 1954–1959 was to be an inexpensive sports car for the youth market. Its good looks and minimalist equipment, which included a cut-down windshield and “emergencies only” top, clicked with customers…including Hollywood Star James Dean who helped make the car famous. The 1989 Speedster was a single model year offering which not coincidentally was the 25th anniversary of the 911.<br><br>Only 2,104 of the new Speedster were built between January and September of 1989 and of that total only 823 were delivered to the US. The Speedster, option M503, was the last variant based on the outgoing K program chassis, that was to be replaced by the new Type 964. Porsche offered the new Speedster in both slant nosed and turbo body variants in Germany but only the turbo look was sold to the US customers. The 911 Speedster was distinctly shaped by Porsche's styling department under the direction of Tony Lapine. It offered a cut down windshield reminiscent of the original that was more than 3 inches lower and raked 5 degrees flatter than that of the standard Cabriolet, a minimal single layer fabric top and a twin ‘camel humps' fiberglass tonneau covered the area where the occasional rear seats would normally reside. The front quarter windows were eliminated and the new side windows were manually operated. Like the original 356 Speedster the new version was rarely seen with its top up.</p><p><br>About this Car:<br><br>It is always a joy when you have the opportunity to acquire such a special car on the market.  This Porsche is that opportunity.  It is a one owner car with only 17,269 miles and always garaged.  Purchased new in California from Vasek Polak Porsche Dealership and has remained in California all of it's life. She sits in amazing condition and drives like new.

Remarkable craftsmanship and attention to detail throughout welcomes both driver and passenger. The firmly bolstered, leather-swathed and deeply contoured Seats in front are in fantastic condition, offering miles of driving pleasure.Nearly devoid of extraneous trim, the low, smooth-bodied 911 looks the part of a serious performance machine. Porsche notes that these 911 Carrera models have a wider track and a slimmer, more accentuated waistline. The Gen-Six incarnation of Porsche's rear-engine sports machine, (internal code 997), overlays the familiar, fluid 911 lines with a bit of retrogressive styling, although the now-signature auto-deploying rear spoiler remains. Porsche reinforced the look that was spawned back in 1964 while expanding the already formidable capabilities of the platform that it replaced.As would be expected from Porsche, long known for its unique sports car engineering, the Carrera comes in with cutting-edge performance technology. Porsche fitted them with dynamic suspension technology capable of handling high-speed cornering. Engine and transmission employ the latest technology to deliver incredible acceleration while keeping fuel economy reasonable.For more information on this 2005 Porsche Carrera Coupe, or any of our 40+ Porsches always in stock, contact one of our friendly and knowledgeable sales consultants or feel free to drop by our 5-acre Bellevue, WA facility - Home to the West Coast's Most Exciting Inventory of Luxury, Exotic, Sports and Collectible Cars with 200+ Always on Site.             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$46,950               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Full Warranty in effect until December of 2019 or 50k miles.The Cayenne GTS provides a concentrated dose of enthusiasm and is designed for impressive performance. This is evident from the large air intakes which are both characteristic and striking. The 3.6-litre twin-turbo V6 engine with direct fuel injection (DFI) offers a level of power that's usually only to be found on the racetrack. An output of 440 hp leaves nothing to be desired, while the lowered steel spring suspension with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) ensures a more direct driving experience. A typical racing sound is provided at the push of a button by the sports exhaust system, fitted as standard. This can be seen from the black twin tailpipes and heard from the throaty roar which changes depending on your driving style. Athletic, powerful and muscular. The Cayenne GTS is a car designed for big emotions. Racing emotions.The prowess of the Cayenne is clearly reflected in the design: the front and rear sections are now sharper and even more sophisticated. The bonnet, front wings, main headlights and air intakes lend the car even greater presence. It is impressively athletic and muscular. The precise lines make it evident that this is a sports car with character and stature. The sporty side contouring and wheels with attractive styling serve to emphasize the car's dynamics. An impression that is confirmed by the daytime running lights featuring four LED spotlights fitted as standard, as well as the LED taillights and integrated tailpipes. Every detail has been used to highlight what matters most to you: the sporting credibility that only a Porsche can offer. That is our design DNA. The result is clear: distinctive appeal. The Cayenne gives the term 'enthusiasm' a face.When you take the wheel of a Porsche, you are part of something bigger. Part of an overall concept. An idea. One that has its roots in motor racing. That's why the interior of the Cayenne is virtually built around you. Everything you need is within easy reach. Practical and exclusively designed to suit your needs. The multifunction sports steering wheel also speaks the language of motorsport. Derived from the 918 Spyder, it is a harmonious blend of high-level ergonomics and pioneering styling.

Originally sold in California  the car's then owner moved to Connecticut in 1976 and took the car with her  at which point the motor promptly blew up. The car was taken off the road and mercifully left on its black license plates. A 1964 356C engine was eventually installed  and the brakes rebuilt but the car remained unregistered and off the road. <br><br>Eventually  the car's current owner became aware of it while living in Connecticut and purchased it with the intention of getting it back on the road to use as a daily driver. One thing led to another and eventually a complete restoration was undertaken. The car was stripped to bare metal and the doors  lids  and bumpers were acid dipped. Metal specialist Nate Cantwell performed minor metal work  including opening the front closing panels to inspect the longitudinals  which were found to be in good shape. These areas were properly cleaned and closed up  while careful attention was applied to rust prevention along with extensive rust-proofing. The entire underside of the car was hand prepped as rust was determined to be minimal.<br><br>Upon completion  the owner was pleased with the finish but realized the finished car was too nice to use as a daily car. Instead  he elected to drive it occasionally and only in good weather  storing it indoors  participating in local events  and servicing it regularly. During his ownership  the car has never been used in inclement weather  not even rain  and has always been garaged. When the restoration was completed  the car showed 70 000 miles and has since covered 26 000 additional miles. <br><br>The car has recently been serviced  including a tune up  oil and filter change  and lube  and a valve adjustment. The transmission fluid was changed and new axle boots were also installed along with new rubber fuel hoses. Additionally  new brake hydraulics and rubber brake hoses were installed  while the brake system was flushed and new Silicon Dot 5 brake fluid filled installed. New shifter bushings  new rear torsion bar bushings  and new front sway bar bushings were also installed  as well as a new set of Pirelli CN36 tires  new wheel bearings and seals  and toe adjustments performed for both the front and rear. <br><br>Today this factory electric sunroof 356 Coupe presents beautifully  and the restoration appears quite crisp still  particularly the paint  which looks more like a ten year old job rather than a 37 year old paint job. The body and structure are exceptionally nice  with excellent gaps and fit. The lacquer paint shows very nicely with high gloss and minor checking visible in selected areas when closely examined. The trim is in good to very good condition overall with minor pitting evident upon close examination on the door window frames and some minor hazing on a few other plated parts. The lenses  lighting  and various trim and script are all in very good condition contributing to the overall cohesive visual presentation of this car. Outfitted with wider 5.5” chrome wheels and European Bosch headlights  the car has a great combination of visual and driving appeal particularly as it is optioned with the factory electric sunroof and original Blaupunkt radio and speakers. <br><br>The black leather interior presents very nicely with excellent fit and finish  showing surprisingly little evidence of use on the seat surfaces  presenting very nicely throughout including the door panels  carpeting  and side panels. The dashboard is extremely nice  having been treated to fully restored instrumentation by Palo Alto Speedometer during the restoration. The dash presents stunning black and red color contrast with the seats and exterior paint  supported by a gloss black steering wheel  excellent aluminum spokes  and glossy Porsche center emblem. The headliner is in good condition  showing slight bagging at the rear  while the correct German Square Weave carpeting remains in very good condition  having been protected by floor mats during the years of careful driving.  <br><br>The engine bay delivers a thoughtful and correct presentation using Porsche parts  correct oil filter canister  correct air cleaners  and appropriate decals. Both the engine compartment and the engine itself are very clean  nicely detailed  and reflect the comprehensive attention to detail afforded when the restoration was completed. The front storage compartment is equally clean and retains the correct properly finished liner and components. The undercarriage is representative of a well-cared for  mostly dry climate example with preserved floor pans  battery box  and original components as one might expect from a car with this history. Further  the underside of the car is absolutely solid. Detailed inspection of the components  floor  and structure reveal a solid car reflective of mild use and regular service over the past 40 years. <br><br>The car is a delight to drive. The engine starts easily and settles into idle smoothly  reflecting the proper tune and recent valve adjustment. The clutch and gearbox are nicely paired with smooth engagement and excellent synchromesh. Power comes on strong in all gears and handling is particularly nimble with the wider wheels  new tires  and recent attention to the suspension components  bushings  and setup. Driving at speed  one is impressed with the integrity and feel of this car  offering smooth driving manners and delightful suspension in combination with the responsive engine performance. The car comes with an original owners manual  Blaupunkt radio manual and schematic diagrams  a partial tool kit  and a jack. <br><br>The quality of this particular 356 is difficult to characterize. Despite having been restored nearly 40 years ago  the car's presentation remains strong. The quality of the work and the pride of ownership are clear in this car. Prepared thoughtfully and professionally  and preserved and maintained by a single owner carefully since  this Porsche 356 B  optioned with the rare factory electric sunroof  is ready to deliver 40 more years of delightful driving and enjoyment to its next fortunate owner.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$99,500               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

But it was way back in 1975 that he developed a completely new look for the 911 racing bodies. His designs would prove to be a large figure on the German racing tracks and go on to win many titles. His partnership with the Kremer brothers also proved to be a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>Their relationship forged modifications to the Porsche 935 (like our street model you see here) which would go on to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans beginning in 1979. In the US they would find similar results in the IMSA series. DP Motorsport went on to redesigning many models starting with the K1 through what is likely the most famous, the coveted Group C 962s.</p> <p>Though Ekkehard's son Patrick runs the company these days, his father's legacy continues through examples like our 935. It truly is a classic in the world of DP. The models over the decades were narrow, then wide, and now a popular option is narrow once again - yet another reason to look closely at our example.</p> <p>Speaking of our example, it's in the final stages of a rotisserie restoration. Restored by a passionate crew, our professionals have done a fantastic job in this meticulous restoration. As you can tell the body has been dipped, refreshed, and repainted. The engine and transmission rebuilt to specifications. As we wait for the interior to be reupholstered as when new, we thought we'd give you a glimpse of what is to come.</p> <p>This vehicle is for those that need that special car for their collection. Serious collectors should call us for additional information.</p> <p>At the Motor Car Group, we're enthusiasts first. We want you to enjoy your new car from the minute it's delivered and the trailer door drops. Before a car leaves our shop, it's gone through comprehensively, both visually and mechanically.

One of very few known to exist in USA specs from 1984, and this one has had just two owners from new!  A wonderfully solid car complete with Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, original tools, and clean Carfax!  A rare chance for serious Porsche collectors! </p><p>It has been long known that nearly any Porsche model offered could be ordered with just about any option a buyer could want, whether it was on the standard order sheet or not. This is what spurred Porsche's Sonderwunsh Programm, aka Special Wishes division, to carry out the custom orders requested by buyers all over the world. Dealers were made aware of the new M491- Turbo-Look option in 1984. For USA buyers, the Turbo was not offered due to emission regulations set forth by our government. This Turbo-Look option may not have earned you the engine, but instead the wide body design, larger wheels, rear spoiler, bigger brakes, and matching suspension components. It could be ordered in Coupe, Targa, or Cabriolet form, as Porsche would not offer a real Turbo in Cabriolet form until 1989. Being a new option, not many were ordered according to the Turbo-Look Registry largely due to expensive cost added to the window sticker, and delayed delivery timeframe. Today, less than a dozen or so are known to exist in Cabriolet form from 1984. This example is one of those ultra-rare few!</p><p>We are exiting to have the opportunity to present this 1984 Porsche 911 Carrera Turbo-Look Cabriolet finished in paint-to-sample code 99- Pearl White Metallic over YY- Burgundy Interior (now fitted with Black leather seating surfaces). Having just two owners from new, this special ordered car was a gift to theoriginal Arkansas buyer's wife as an anniversary present. It retains an all numbers matching 3.2L Horizontal Flat 6 cylinder engine with 5-speed transmission, and fitted with factory Blaupunkt Monterey cassette radio, cruise control, front &amp; rear license plates, heated &amp; tinted windshield, deleted rear identification plate, and USA spec gauges. They continued their ownership and care until December 2010 when it finally traded hands with only 44,000 miles on the odometer. The second owner, another Ozark PCA member, took possession and maintained it until our purchase with 55,094 miles on the odometer. He took some liberties to fully service the car over the last 6 years to include new head temp sensor, DME relay, &amp; fuel pump relay in 2011, new crankshaft positioning sensors, rear brake pads, all new BF Goodrich g-Force Sport Comp 2 tires, along with fluid change completed in 2015 by Perfection Plus based in Little Rock, AR. A new fuel pump was swapped in 2016. Upon arrival here at the St Louis Car Museum, the air conditioning system was fully vacuumed to test for leaks, a new blower motor switch was replaced, then charged with R134a refrigerant for proper operation. We also changed the engine bay sound mat, replaced the front door speaker grills, rear center reflector and weather seal, and completed a fresh engine oil/filter change.</p><p>We will provide the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, original tool kit, and a clean CarFax report to the next lucky owner. This vehicle's exterior has been repainted once while still with the original owners along with a new replacement convertible soft top &amp; all seat covers. The original boot cover and storage bag are present. It continues to run and drive just wonderfully, with proper accident-free and rust-free fit of all panels throughout!

This 356A has a 1.6 Liter (1,600cc's) engine, with a 4 speed manual transmission. Porsche contracted Reutter to build the steel bodies and eventually bought the Reutter company in 1963. Eventually changing it's name to Recaro. This car is flawless inside and out and run's like new. This car draws a lot of attention and is an excellent collector car with excellent history. Optional equipment as listed by the factory Porsche authenticity certificate include: Sealed beam headlights, Hirschmann antenna, Ponto Stabil Mirror, and white wall tires (not currently equipped on vehicle and not included in sale). Certificate of authenticity engine #: 22484. Transmission #: 16016. This Porsche comes with Florida title and correct mileage stated. This was originally a European spec car that was believe to be brought over to the United States by a high ranking European Military official. As the original front bumpers do not have the overrider bars which were equipped on U.S. spec 356A's. This Porsche has a verified production date of 08/23/1957 and comes with the official Porsche Factory Certification paperwork (letter of authenticity). Miles are completely original and have been verified. This 356A is also listed on the national Porsche 356 registry! This is your rare opportunity to own this spectacular example of a beautiful Porsche 356A Reutter coupe. Only 1,171 of these coupes were made in 1957. HISTORY: This 356A started life in Europe and was imported to the United States sometime before 1962 by a high ranking military official from Europe. It is a European coupe because it does not have the overrider bars on the bumper and it had the 1300cc motor. All Porsches designed to be imported to the U.S. had the overrider bars. It was purchased in 1962 for $1,700 in Oakland California by a gentleman named Carl. The 2nd owner of the car had it repainted in Red. They drove the car and loved the car for 13 years in total. After some time the car was starting to get worn, the owners family was growing and the car did not work well for their situation at that time. So, the car was parked, as it was not running well. He parked it with the intention of restoring it some day. That never came to reality, so his wife asked him to sell it. At this time, the 3rd owner showed up in 1975 and was sold. The 3rd owner paid $1,500 for the car. At that time the car was 100% original except for the repaint and different bumpers (which the 2nd owner had kept the original bumpers, and gave to the now 3rd owner). And the car was 100% rust free.

In 1994, the Porsche 911 underwent a complete redesign. Labeled with the Porsche internal designation 993, this all-new car was a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective. This reimagining of the classic European sports coupe resulted in a longer, wider, and sleeker 911 that still echoed the classic 911 silhouette. Porsche's engineers devised a new light-alloy subframe with coil and wishbone suspension components that resulted in a significant improvement in engine weight disbursement and vehicle handling. The new 993 created a more civilized car, with better than ever quality, that provided an unmatched driving experience. This well maintained black 911 Carrera has the perfect combination of performance and features that make any drive a thrill. Averaging less than 3,000 miles per year, this Carrera is in exceptional condition and has certainly been very well cared for its entire life. Power is courtesy of the proven 3.6 liter flat-six engine producing over 270 horsepower and is connected to a six-speed gearbox. On the outside the aggressive seventeen-inch Porsche alloy wheels are wrapped in sticky Michelin Pilot Sport tires and come to a halt via the four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. Inside the cabin is a long list of features and options such as leather bucket seats, air conditioning, power windows, power sunroof, cruise control, Kenwood stereo system and VDO instrumentation just to name a few. Revered by the automotive world as the last complete modern classic the 911 Carrera is a wonderfully composed machine delivering elegance and muscle all in one package. For a fraction of the cost of a new one...this beautiful 911 Carrera provides all the fun, comfort, and style of one of Germany's greatest cars.

In 1971, the third owner purchased this 912 also a So-Cal resident. In this 43 year span, the third owner kept extensive records dating back to 1971. In 1983 the engine went through a rebuild which was completed by Automation.

WP0AA0917BS120608,Porsche,911,,911 SC,1981,59858,Fort Worth,TX ,2018-04-25,54995,Used,Dealership,,Black,Black,Manual,,1981 Porsche 911 SC,https://www.hemmings.com/classifieds/dealer/porsche/911/2083011.html,,"<p>Porsche brought out the 911SC with a fairly specific intent - to revitalize the line - and took extra steps to make it special, providing it with a slightly wider body than its immediate predecessors, and dropping a sturdier engine into its engine bay. The results exceeded their expectations, actually staving off Porsche's plan to replace the 911 just a few years later, as the renewed popularity of the model made the change a clearly unwise move. This 1981 Porsche 911SC, with only about 60,000 miles under its belt and harboring a clean history report in its glove box, is a sterling example of German automotive engineering that's sure to provide its next owner with miles of driving exhilaration. <br> <br> This SC looks every inch the able bodied, upgraded sports car it was intended to be. Take a look at it from the front, and you're likely to notice its widened track - directly borrowed from the Carreras of the time. Step to the back and you'll see its signature wing jutting out to provide the downdraft that makes this already formidable corner carver stick even more tenaciously to the asphalt around turns. Despite its more than 35 years on the road, this 911 remains very solid and straight - the gaps separating its doors from the fenders in front and back are very consistent, and its front and rear bumpers sit nice and level, with black rubber that remains unscuffed. It's always reassuring to hear a rattle-free ''thud'' as you close the door upon entering the cockpit and that's just what you'll find here, as well. The sunroof is a great feature - especially on sunny days - and it's functioning in top form. <br> <br> Just climbing inside to take your place behind the wheel makes you feel like a practiced high-performance driver. It's a great environment you'll find here, with a pair of black leather buckets that have held up very well and remain comfortable and supportive, and a rear seat area that shows very little use at all. From the looks of things, driver and passengers alike have exercised some caution during journeys, as the door panels look nice and fresh on both sides and still sit flush to their steel frames, the dash area shows no evidence of any mishaps, and the power windows raise and lower smoothly. The VDO gauges residing in the instrument cluster remain clear and readable. The only exception to the consistently stock condition you'll find inside is a great add-on - an AM/FM/CD player sitting front and center in the dash to look after your audio needs while on the road. The storage area up front is surprisingly spacious and as clean as you could want - even with the steel brace residing inside to add to body rigidity, there's an appreciable amount of luggage space.<br> <br> You'll find a 3.0 liter 6 cylinder sitting underneath the hood in back that's still at the top of its game. Porsches are known for their longevity - especially when compared to other performance-centric brands - and this powerplant, being so lightly traveled, is very much in its prime, starting up quickly and running great. It's paired with a 5-speed manual transmission to provide just the ''hands-on'' driving experience you'd want in a car like this. Featuring high-revving performance to go along with its timeless looks, this quintessential German sports car sits on a set of 16'' black polished Porsche wheels that carry Yokohama tires. <br> <br> With its coveted combination of collectible cachet and exhilarating, road-ready performance, this 1981 Porsche 911SC would be an outstanding centerpiece for any enthusiast's garage.

Featuring visual improvements such as an outside fuel filler cap and the rear twin grilles over the engine compartment, they incorporated the many of the design characteristics early Porsche buyers came to expect with its introduction. Shortcomings in design and execution had years to be identified, analyzed, massaged and eliminated. The Porsche flat four was close to bulletproof. Rear suspension revisions long since refined and perfected had rendered its handling characteristics nearly flawless. Additionally, these models further represent the pinnacle of the series as four-wheel disc brakes became standard items on the 356, as did ZF transmissions and upgraded high output engines with stronger internal components. Construction had matured until the cars' fit, finish and function set the standard for which other manufacturers strived. The production Porsches existed in parallel with their racing counterparts, benefiting from the innovations of racing, but pursuing their own course toward meeting, and exceeding, the expectations of customers. <br><br>To most Porsche enthusiasts, the C version of the 356 represents not only the last, but the best of the line. The 1964 Porsche 356C Coupe by Karmann offered here is an eye-catching matching numbers example that was professionally restored and finished in stunning Signal Red with a beautiful black interior. This original California 356C Coupe has been beautifully restored; it was recently serviced and is now ready to be shown or driven. Accompanying this matching numbers investment-grade 356C Coupe is its Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, owner's manual, service records, toolkit and more.

It presents in the classic color combination of black with a matching black vinyl interior featuring Pepita Houndstooth cloth inserts. Featuring the iconic Fuchs alloys polished to a mirror-like sheen, these 5-bolt/14-inch diameter wheels are exclusive to the 914-6. All 914-6 cars were fitted with the Appearance Group, which consisted of front and rear chrome bumpers, auxiliary driving lights and vinyl covering on the roll-bar sill panels. The 914-6 also had a rear-bumper shape different than its 4-cylinder brethren with vertical versus angled delineations creating the center-section indentation. The 914-6 was a limited-production automobile with only 3,300 examples built from 1970-72. However, it had a major impact on the automotive world during its short three-year production run. It was the recipient of international acclaim in 1970 when it took first in class at the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race. It also found major-league racing success stateside when it won the 1971 IMSA GTU Championship—winning five out of the six races in the series—piloted by ace Porsche drivers Peter Gregg and Hurley Haywood. It was a brilliant design with an amidship engine placement, a 911 front suspension, 4-wheel disc brakes, a 5-speed gearbox and fully independent rear suspension. The body was of unit construction and featured an integrated roll hoop—affectionately referred to as the “basket handle”—which served both as a safety roll bar and a structural element that provided additional platform rigidity. These cars captured the hearts of the motoring public based on their exceptional handling and balance combined with the open-air driving experience.

IT WAS RECOVERED WITH LIGHT FRONT END DAMAGE AND THE WHEELS WERE REMOVED.  SINCE THE INSURANCE CLAIM WAS PAID THE INSURANCE COMPANY WAS THE FIRST OWNER REPORTED ON 08-01-1991 AND A SALVAGE TITLE WAS ISSUED.  THE INSURANCE COMPANY SOLD THE CAR ON 09-04-1991 WITH 971 MILES AND A TITLE WAS ISSUED.  THE CAR WAS REPAIRED AND ON 10-15-1992 A REBUILT TITLE WAS ISSUED.  THE OWNER MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AND ON 05-22-1993 WITH 8,092 MILES IT PASSED AN EMISSIONS INSPECTION.  THE CAR WAS TITLED IN CALIFORNIA ON 06-01-1993.  THE OWNER MOVED TO OREGON AND ON 12-21-1993 A TITLE WAS ISSUED.  ON 04-21-1994 AN ODOMETER READING WAS REPORTED WITH 9,152 MILES.  ON 05-19-1995 AN ODOMETER READING WAS REPORTED WITH 12,625 MILES.  ON 08-16-2002 THE CAR WAS SERVICED WITH 15,615 MILES.  THE CAR WAS PURCHASED BY A DEALERSHIP IN PENNSYLVANIA ON 01-31-2003 WITH 16,688 MILES.  ON 09-16-2003 THE CAR WAS SERVICED WITH 18,010 MILES.

THIS TITLE CAN BE TRANSFERRED INTO THE NEW OWNERS NAME AND TITLED IN ALL 50 STATES WITH NO ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>***INSPECTION***</p><p>PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE MS CLASSIC CARS WAS ABLE TO DO A THOROUGH INSPECTION.  THE INSPECTION WAS VERY POSITIVE.  DURING THE INSPECTION AN ELECTRIC PAINT METER WAS USED TO DETERMINE WHAT PAINTWORK HAD BEEN DONE.  THE HOOD, TWO FRONT FENDERS AND SMALL AREA IN THE FRONT OF DOORS INDICATED PRIOR PAINT WORK.  ALL THE REMAINING BODY PANELS ON THE CAR INDICATED FACTORY ORIGINAL PAINT.  LISTED BELOW IN THE PHOTOS ARE PHOTOS OF THE PAINT METER ON MULTIPLE AREAS OF THE CAR TO DOCUMENT.  AS STATED ON THE FENDER SPLENDOR GUIDE, “SOME CARS COME FROM THE FACTORY WITH PAINT IN THE 3.5 MIL RANGE, AND SOME COME AS HIGH AS 7-9 MILS OR MORE”. SINCE THERE WAS NO SIGNS OF ANY SERIOUS STRUCTURAL DAMAGE IT WAS DETERMINED THE CAR MUST HAVE HAD LIGHT DAMAGE AND REQUIRED PAINT WORK WHICH WAS BLENDED INTO THE FRONT PART OF THE DOORS.  THE PAINT WORK WAS DONE VERY PROFESSIONALLY AND ISN'T NOTICABLE.  KEEP IN MIND IT WAS DONE 25+ YEARS AGO.  PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF PHOTOS LOOK LIKE DIFFERENT SHADES OF RED BUT THAT IS THE LIGHTING FROM TAKING PHOTOS AT DIFFERENT ANGLES.  THE OVERALL CONDITION OF THE CARS EXTERIOR, INTERIOR, ENGINE COMPARTMENT, TRUNK COMPARTMENT AND UNDERCARRIAGE WAS IN BEAUTIFUL ORIGINAL CONDITION.  THE CAR WAS ALSO MECHANICALLY SOUND AND FUNCTIONED BEAUTIFULLY. THE CAR HAD BEEN OWNED BY TWO RESPECTABLE OWNERS FROM PENNSYLVANIA FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS AND IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A LOW MILEAGE CAR.  MS CLASSIC CARS JUMPED ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE ONE OF THE MOST DESIRABLE EUROPEAN CLASSIC SPORTS CARS OF ALL TIME.  SINCE WE'VE TAKEN OWNERSHIP WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE PROFESSIONALS GIVE THERE OPINION ON THE CAR AND EVERYBODY AGREES IT WAS LIGHTLY DAMAGED WHEN THE CAR WAS NEW.</p><p> </p><p>***SERVICE***</p><p>MS CLASSIC CARS HAS AN EXCELLENT REPUTATION AND WE TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN SERVICING AND DETAILING THE VEHICLES WE SELL.  WE DOCUMENT THIS WITH AN INVOICE WHICH IS PRESENTED WITH THE PHOTOS WITH OUR LISTINGS.  WE SERVICE OUR OWN VEHICLES BUT IT MADE SENSE TO HAVE THIS CAR SERVICED AT AN AUTHORIZED PORSCHE DEALERSHIP.

This Turbo is in outstanding condition throughout, runs and drives excellent and, at a fraction of original sticker, represents plethoric Porsche performance and panache at a palatable price.The Porsche 911 Turbo is considered as one of the most iconic models in the history of the industry. There aren't many sports cars that have been around as long as the 911, and none that have stayed as true to the original's formula. At the same time, Porsche has managed to transform the 911 into a modern sports car with the performance and amenities buyers expect. It's an icon of the sports car world. Powering this 911 Turbo, fittingly, is a twin-turbocharged 3.6L H6 engine that is factory-rated at 480hp/460lb-ft. In this example, the twin-turbo engine is backed by a silky-smooth and lightning-quick Tiptronic S transmission. All-wheel drive is standard, along with a power rear spoiler and Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM).The cockpit of this Porsche maintains basic design themes from the past but boasts cleaner layouts and enhanced functionality, particularly the classic instrument cluster that includes a high resolution, multi-function screen, a central rev counter, and an ignition lock to the left of the steering wheel. Though the cabin has a function-oriented layout, upscale materials on the doors and dashboard, and remarkable craftsmanship and attention to detail throughout welcomes both driver and passenger. The black leather seats in front are firmly bolstered and deeply contoured, and are in excellent condition, offering miles of comfortable driving.For more information on this fabulous and low miles 2008 Porsche Turbo Cabriolet, or any of our 40+ Porsches always in stock, contact our friendly and knowledgeable sales team or feel free to drop by our Bellevue, WA showroom - Home of the West Coast's Most Exciting Inventory of Luxury, Exotic, High Performance and Collectible Automobiles.

The 1964-65 model years represented the final evolution of the 356 model. With that evolution came the highest specific output pushrod 4-cylinder engine ever available from Porsche. The SC engine produced 15 percent more horsepower than the standard C engine and featured a stouter counter-weighted crankshaft, short skirt pistons, a more radical camshaft configuration and large Solex carburetors. This generation of Porsche also featured 4-wheel disc brakes and the SC came with Koni shocks as standard equipment. Prior to the final two years of production, the majority of the bodies for the 356 were constructed by Reutter with the remaining coachwork subcontracted out to other Karosserie such as Karmann, D'Ieteren and Drauz. In May of 1964, Porsche purchased Reutter and retained its services for seat design and manufacturing purposes, but sent coachwork to Karmann. Hence, this body is a 356SC Karmann coupe—but not to be confused with the Karmann coupes which were of notchback design that were produced in 1961-62. This 356 coupe has undergone a recent and comprehensive restoration including a bare-shell respray in the original color, replacement of all rubber trim and the brightwork polished. The suspension, brakes and steering components each were rebuilt. The interior received a new headliner, new carpet and new seat leatherette installed. This 356 comes with a number of desirable options including a chrome horn ring, luggage straps, factory Blaupunkt radio with antenna and loudspeakers and chrome wheels and hubcaps. Also included is the driver's manual, tool roll, jack, matching spare tire and both a factory-issued Kardex and Certificate of Authenticity.</p><p>Additional photographs available upon request.</p><p>Call Max. 208-720-8854</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$130,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Before going further into describing the car, let me provide a few important details:  This is a CA car that lived part of its life in a very dry hot climate. The car has serious Patina/Sun damaged paint and an interesting look when this old warn paint is sanded flat and machine polished...Keep the Patina or  repaint it and new front seat covers.

Its lengthy history extends over 50 years of production and to this day, the iconic design lines are still utilized. Throughout the 911's long life, it has steadily evolved becoming more refined but still maintaining the essence of its roots. The air-cooled era spawned some of Porsche's greatest creations and by 1989, they released what is referred  to as the 964 series. The 964 was a milestone in the 911 lineage, as it saw a variety of technologies that were yet to be integrated as standard features in addition to having a new, re engineered chassis. In terms of major cosmetic changes, the 964 received redesigned front and rear bumpers for better aerodynamics and an electronic, self-deploying rear wing for added down force at high speeds. ABS and power steering were made a standard feature for the 964, as well as a 3.6 L flat six that propelled the car to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds.</p><p><br>This 964 on offer is a hard to find 1 owner car from Florida with 79 thousand miles on the dial. The shwartz paint is in good condition as well as the original black interior. The seats are in great condition as seen in the photos with minimal wear for a car of this age, the dashboard has no cracks and the headliner is also in good condition. All windows and sunroof as well as all electronics function as they should. This Carrera 4 is all stock unmolested and un-restored. The gorgeous cup wheels have brand new tires all around and no curb rash what soever. The original owner we got the vehicle from  had the car sit for a good amount of time so the vehicle just had a recent service that included a brand new fuel system brand new battery/ ignition. The car drives great the clutch is soft engages easily with no grinds and the engine is healthy and strong pulling through every gear effortlessly. </p><p>Along with the sale of this vehicle comes a clean car fax no accidents, all books,manuals and two keys  with plenty of stamps in the maintenance book.</p><p>See walk around video below..<br>https://youtu.be/lm0fjVTdkKk</p><p>Serious Inquiries Call Eddie 786-377-4331 or Danny 786-291-3622</p><p>Follow us on Instagram for live updates! @ realmusclecar,com<br>Can Ship (Insured) Anywhere Worldwide if Needed.<br>Located in Miami, Florida 33126<br>Financing Available with Approved Credit<br>Trades Always Welcomed (UP or DOWN)</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$54,500 obo               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Art Bunker Porsche was one of three premier Porsche dealerships in the US with a close ties to Porsche and was to obtain and sell the '73 RS and the 914-6 GT.  In 1973 only 925 911S Targa's were produced making them rarer than the coveted 1973 RS.  This project started as a local barn find of a partially disassembled 911S and was intended to be a limited restoration to produce a nice driver to keep.  As these things sometimes go however it quickly turned in to a rotisserie restoration to better than original condition, with a stack of receipts totaling over $200,000. Now it must be sold to pay off bills.  Everything on the car is either brand new or completely restored. The car has undergone a complete, intensive restoration by Devlin Rod and Custom of Wichita Kansas and is in better than new condition both inside and out.</p><p> </p><p>The exterior was completely stripped to metal and repainted in its original color of metallic silver. Every bit of rust was removed and replaced with Porsche steel and assembled by a true craftsman.  The wheel wells and underside were completely restriped to rule out any possible corrosion and recoated with Werth undercoating.  The interior floor pan was stripped down and recoated as well.  There is not one bit of rust or bondo on this car. The Targa top was reupholstered using the correct vinyl by Dave Brown of Boulder Co.  All seals, rubber and hoses are new.  All trim was either replaced w/ OEM trim or restored by Kings of Trim.  The restoration of the original lettering and engine deck lid grill by Kings of Trim is amazing.  The old windshield was replaced with a brand new OEM correct windshield. All 4 turn signal / brake light lens on date correct / NOS Bosch lens. </p><p>The original engine block was lost to history and replaced by a 7R block as opposed to the original 5R used in the early 73 production cars.  The remainder of the engine is original.  It was completely rebuilt by Tim Owen of Topeka Kansas. The case, heads and crank were sent out to Ollie's for reconditioning and preparation to be converted to a fire breathing 2.7L RS engine. All new 2.7L cylinders, S pistons, bearings and seals were installed along with Carrera chain tensioners. An original, date correct, S MFI pump was rebuilt and installed along with completely restored stacks, injector lines and throttle bodies by Eurometrix. All new injectors are installed. The oil cooler and oil tank have been restored by Pacific Oil Cooler.  Although not originally equipped with, an all-new '73 correct trombone fender oil cooler and plumbing was installed to keep the bigger engine cool.  A new red heat shroud is used and all tin has been powder coated black. The transmission was completely rebuilt. A new Sachs clutch kit was installed, the flywheel was turned and balanced and all shifter bushings were replaced.  The starter and alternator are brand new.  The fan and housing were restored by Mark Motshagen. The distributor was rebuilt by Burnham performance.  </p><p> </p><p>All wiring harnesses are new from Kroon.  The electrical panel from the engine bay was completely restored and the CDI was rebuilt by Bob Ashlock.   </p><p> </p><p>Its original Fuchs have been restored by Harvey Weidman and new tires installed, including the spare. The ride height has been set to Euro specs. The brake system was completely rebuilt including all calipers by PMB, brand new pads, discs, master cylinder, soft lines and replated hard lines.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The interior had the front seats rebuilt with top grain soft leather and the door tops and dash pads were reconditioned by Tony Garcia of Autobahn Interiors who also provided the new, correct carpet. The remainder of the interior has been completely redone and restored to original to include new (correct date stamped) front seat belts and reels. A brand new dash from Lakewell was installed as well as a new speaker. The original gauges, including a 180mph speedometer were reconditioned and updated by North Hollywood Speedometer and work like new.  The car was originally radio delete and remains so today.  Every piece of plastic and rubber in the cabin has been replaced with new pieces. </p><p> </p><p>All of the suspension has been completely rebuild with all new bushings, bearings and new Koni shocks.  All parts have been either repainted or powder coated black.  The steering rack was completely rebuilt and a new Turbo tie rod kit has been installed. </p><p> </p><p>The car comes with the original owner's manual, jack; most of the tools and case, Porsche COA and paperwork dating back to the 1970's which includes records for the recent restoration. The sale will also include a flash drive with pictures detailing the restoration. The car runs and drives just like you would expect a '73 911S to run, only faster.  </p><p> </p><p>Links to photos:</p><p> </p><p>Finished Photos</p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0yknedes3sqtsby/AADvq_FfBAdl_ml3TBDKaWR5a?dl=0</p><p> </p><p>Targa Story Photos</p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sujqm9itf0e1ho/AADj5wD0Ht3UD0cWQ5_AHJG6a?dl=0</p><p> </p><p>ESR Story</p><p>http://www.early911sregistry.org/forums/showthread.php?133014-1973-S-Targa&amp;highlight=1973+Targa</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$225,000 negotiable               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Imported back in 1985 by it's second owner, this rare and very desirable 3.0 Carrera Targa produces over 210HP and is actually faster than it's coveted 1973 911 Carrera RS sibling. It is the only 911 that shares a 930 engine case with the famed 930 Turbo cars.</strong></p><p><strong>I was fortunate enough to buy a 1977 911 3.0 Carrera Coupe back in the early 80's when I was importing European Specification cars from all over Europe. I remember being incredibly impressed with the lightning fast acceleration and overall feel and handling characteristics of the Euro Spec Carrera . It became one of my favorite Porsche cars of all time. Since that time, I have always been on the lookout for 3.0 Carreras and have strongly believed that they represent one of the best kept secrets in the Porsche market. Many collectors base their desire to purchase certain model 911's simply on their production numbers. The 3.0 Carrera is not only a limited production run model but also offers incredible performance and driver feedback. The gears are long and the instantaneous acceleration is unlike any 911 of it's era. The 3.0 Carrera engine produces a sound that is unique to this model and is the quintessential air cooled 911 musical note.</strong></p><p><strong>Only 646 3.0 Carrera Targas were built in 1977. Of those, only 365 were Left Hand Drive models. A rare car indeed.</strong></p><p><strong>The Targa presented here has just been treated to a recent engine rebuild by Rennwerke Porsche as well as many other mechanical repairs including new Koni shocks and fresh bushings all around. The accident and rust free body was taken down to bare metal and resprayed in it's original Ice Green Metallic color. The interior also received a freshening with new carpets and reupholstered seats.</strong></p><p><strong>The 15 inch by 7 and 8 inch wide factory Fuchs alloy wheels were sent to Harvey Weidman where they received a factory RS style finish before being fitted with new Pirelli tires.</strong></p><p><strong>The car has been gone through from top to bottom and is totally sorted and ready to be enjoyed by it's next fortunate owner.</strong></p><p><strong>All serious inquiries should be directed to Mark Starr at +1 (914) 217-4817.</strong></p><p> </p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

While the 911 was and is still today considered a pure sports car, the 928 was a Grand Tourer and one of few Porsches to feature a front engine design. Porsche engineers were able to achieve a 50/50 weight distribution by mounting a transaxle in the rear. This achievement was praised given the V8 engine layout and made the 928 an extremely well handling car with more potential for higher power output. The accolades quickly came in for Porsche and the 928 was awarded the 1978 European Car of the Year, one of very few sports cars to ever claim the title. Considered the flagship performance GT car of its day, the 928 Porsche is still capable of leaving an impression against modern sports cars. <br><br>Midway through the 1986 928S model year production, Porsche introduced several improvements. Cars with a VIN sequence number exceeding 1001 are referred to as the 1986.5 models and featured a 5.0 liter V8 engine. A 16 valve cylinder head allowed for an improved torque curve and produced 288 horsepower. The braking system was upgraded to ABS beginning in the 1986 model year, but the 1986.5 models featured larger brakes that would eventually be featured on the 928S4 models beginning in 1987. The higher level of performance matched with the lighter 928S platform makes the 1986.5 928S one of the most sought-after 928 Porsche models, especially in rare 5-speed manual transmission form.<br><br>The 1986.5 Porsche 928S Sunroof Coupe featured here is finished in stunning Guards Red with an impeccably kept Gray Beige leather interior. This magnificent 928S Sunroof Coupe is among one of the finest examples we have had the pleasure of offering in many years.

It was originally sold new to Ronald Whittier a SVP at Intel from the local Palo Alto Porsche Dealership. After long-term ownership Ronald gave the car to his son John Whittier in the early 2000's. The car was never re-titled an sent to Sun Valley Auto Club for storage. It wasn't until 2012 when Sun Valley was able to purchase the Porsche from John. The car was a hot topic of discussion and highly sought after by club members while in the possession of Sun Valley Auto Group so needless so say it wasn't long before the car found a new owner.</p><p>Tim Wolfe was a  member of Sun Valley Auto Club himself. He commissioned Sun Valley to restore the vehicle to its original luster. The vehicle underwent a no expense spared rebirth,  over $13,000 was invested at a club member rate retail cost of such an operation would have been closer to $25,000. The Vehicle received a full Service, its entire fuel delivery system was refurbished including  full rebuild to the carbs, its exhaust system, brakes front and back, its ignition and charging system we all addressed.</p><p> The car was then sold to a local Sun Valley resident who was also a collector, unfortunately he didn't drive the car much claiming “it was just too fast for him”. The vehicle was then sold to its current owner “our client” a Porsche Club member and enthusiasts of Encinitas, Ca. The current owner is quite meticulous this was not his first 911 nor his last and he knew exactly what to do with it.  He gave the car the proper refreshing it deserved. Under his custodianship  the car received a full rebuild to the transmission replaced all synchro's, its suspension was serviced and car was lowered ½ inch, he Fixed all oil leaks, most recently the fuel tank was removed and relined with new fuel lines. Many other new parts, seals, trim &amp; molding pieces, wiring   etc were all addressed. Being in the hands of a Porsche specialists he really brought the car to more reliable state for touring and daily drives, also paying much attention to the exterior he brought its cosmetics up to a standard suitable for showing. After nearly two years of tinkering the car is dead-spot right on point. All its quarks have been fixed, the car runs and drives better then new.</p><p> </p><p> Its exterior finish although not the original Signal Orange it  is a stunning and beautiful Anthracite gray which complements its original interior well. Accompanied by its Certificate of Authenticity the vehicle has been verified to have its original engine with 47,000 original miles, coupled to a freshly rebuilt original 5 speed this car is a wonderful vehicle to drive. COA shows original order as a 1971 911T Karmann Coupe Vin# 911120444.</p><p> </p><p>The early 911's are still continuing to skyrocket in value with virtually no end in sight only 11,000 or so '71 911T's  were original built and percentage wise we do not believe too many survived. This is an excellent opportunity to own and enjoy a fun appreciating asset. Some recent auction sales of 1971 911's  have been recorded up to $173,000 from 62,000 over the past 3 year period, most recently in January or 2016 a 1971 T sold at Bonham's for $110,000 plus buyers fee(10%) several currently  on the market can be found advertised up to $160,000 plus and many in the $110,000-120k range. We feel we have priced this fabulous car conservatively for its excellent condition to allow a very fair and reasonable sale in a short time. Do not miss out on this opportunity the cars are going up monthly and another 10% will be added to its value in a very short time. </p><p> </p><p>Call David at 1-619-515-2220 or 1-619-451-2130 email us at <a data-toggle=""modal"" href=""#myModal"" id=""contact-seller""> [Email Dealer] </a> </p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$105,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Mechanical improvements and additional comfort increased drivability.  Further changes took place in 1958 with new steering and the now twin carbureted, 1,600 cc engine reverting back to standard bearings and cast-iron cylinders. With their beautifully minimalistic design and carefree drivability, 356A's and Pre-A's have become highly sought after and truly represent the core essence of Porsche.</p> <p>Offered here is a sporting example of the last model year 356 A Coupe. 107183 was completed on March 31, 1959 as a U.S. equipped Ruetter Coupe, distributed by Hoffman Motor Car Company of New York, wearing exquisite Meissen Blue paint over Red leatherette upholstery, as confirmed by accompanying Porsche Kardex and Certificate of Authenticity. In the previous decade, this California car was the recipient of a comprehensive restoration to outstanding results of which still present very well today. The previous caretaker whom commissioned the effort, coordinated top specialists around the Costa Mesa area to complete the rotisserie restoration, with over $60,000 in recorded expenses at the time. All mechanical and electrical systems were addressed and refreshed to new, as were the cosmetics, including a fully tailored leather cabin with all instruments in proper working order. The car displays tight panel fit and excellent, thin finishes as the car was properly stripped beforehand. Its body #183 appears stamped on the rear deck lid, which covers its original and appropriately displayed 1600cc engine. A corresponding 10/58 date stamped gas tank resides up front, as does the matching spare tire assembly with leather strap, original jack and a concours quality tool kit.</p> <p>Drivability and power is absolutely dialed in. We recently had the privilege to display the Porsche at a local Cars &amp; Coffee event in Downtown Houston, and not only was the reception overwhelming, but we were beyond impressed with the 356's handling and ease of use in modern traffic and freeway speeds – a truly versatile instrument for nearly any vintage automotive event. Quality ''A'' coupes are becoming very difficult to source as Pre-A's have sky rocketed in values. They are the essence to the birth of Porsche and will surly continue to appreciate in popularity - especially in unique factory form, such as this example. 107183 offers many possibilities to its next caretaker and is now available for worldwide purchase and delivery from our Houston, Texas showroom.</p> <p>$189,500.00</p> <p>To learn more about this vehicle, please contact our sales department at (281) 497-1000 or <a data-toggle=""modal"" href=""#myModal"" id=""contact-seller""> [Email Dealer] </a></p> <p>SELLING YOUR CAR?</p> <p>Our Philosophy is Selling Made Simple!

The long hood Porsche 911 in 1973 would become the first car to receive the now famous two letters from Stuttgart, and would be the beginning of the Rennsport line.</p> <p>Shipped from Germany and delivered in Italy, #488 is a one of the original 500 cars that were slated to be made for race homologation purposes. The car was then sold to an owner in Japan in 1974 and would remain on the island for more than three decades before coming to America in the hands of a Southern California collector.</p> <p>Once acquiring the car in 2006, the new owner set to work to restore the car back to its former glory. The car was then carefully disassembled, with all of the original windows removed and interior taken out for restoration. The scratched original paint was stripped off the car down to bare metal, noting that the car had no dents whatsoever with no previous damage. The car was refinished in its correct single stage black paint as per the original color code from Porsche. The entire interior was completely retrimmed back to OEM standards. Genuine Porsche parts were sourced, including a new roof liner, carpet, vinyl and dash were used, with the original sports seats stripped, powder coated and then reupholstered.</p> <p>Mechanically the Carrera is just as stunning as it is cosmetically. It's 2.7 liter flat six and type 915 transmission were rebuilt from the ground up to the fullest extent, with no damage to either components besides normal wear. Front and rear suspension systems were completely rebuilt, with new bushings, shocks, new front A arms and new Lobro CV axles. The brakes were also serviced, with new hoses and hard lines. The finishing touch was new front to rear oil lines that replaced the original aging lines. With the restoration completed, the owner would drive the car sparingly before selling it to Canepa in October of 2013.</p> <p>Shortly after arriving at Canepa in 2013, the car would then be sold to a collector in Pebble Beach. He would end up driving the car sparingly as the previous owner did, and the RS would return to Canepa in February of 2018.</p> <p>Since arriving back at Canepa, the Carrera RS has gone through the entire ''Canepa Difference'' process. All of the mechanicals were addressed so that the car now performs perfectly. The interior, exterior and underside were cleaned by hand, with no spot or crevice was left untouched. The single stage black paint was polished with only foam pads and polish, where now the paint has a lustrous shine that rivals any concours car. Now this fully restored, original series Carrera RS is ready for its next owner. Whether that being taking home awards on the lawn or even taking a spirited drive down the twisties, this Porsche 911 Carrera RS was originally made to please and still does the job in spades.</p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Shine a mile deep with OZ racing wheels for a little pop! This is one of the few of these cars that came with the Special M393 Chassis. It has all the options one could wish for.  Electric Sunroof, High end stereo (not stock but I have the original) Heated Power Seats, Head light washers, Cruise Control, and is sitting on a new set of Sumitomo Tires.  Over the last two years I have had the car gone through bumper to bumper.  The engine has been completely rebuilt.  It was sent to three different machine shops, in different parts of the lower 48, who each specialize in a different area. For instance,  Re-creating the same as brand new cylinder surface that measures exactly as stock, done just as the factory created them to begin with.  Same with the heads/valves, rotating assembly.   A new hydraulic system for the clutch and brakes was installed as were all hoses etc.  All work was performed by a factory trained mechanic who now specializes in restoration work. He even had the bolts cleaned, polished and remarked with factory markings. It is currently wearing a whale tail rear spoiler, but I have the original engine cover and spoiler and they are in great shape.  Just preferred the larger tale but hey, thats me, you would have the option for both.  I have the Certificate of Authenticity and original window sticker. I am the third owner and have owned the car for 14 years. My wife and I have put 24,120 miles on it during that perion of time.  Have all service records since new.  Things that are</strong>? <strong>NOT </strong>stock:  Dual exhaust, stereo, wheels,Whales Tail with engine cover.  I am sorry to say I do not have a set of Fuchs wheels to go with but when I bought it they were not with the car. FYI saw a nice used set for $2,000.00 on Craigs List.  To any purchaser who buys this car at full price I will include shipping to your destination in lower 48 or Hawaii.  Thanks for taking the time to read this ad.

Originally delievered as a factory-built 914, the car has been the recipient of siginificant mechanical and aesthetic upgrades to achieve optimal performance and enhance it's sporty looks, taking inspiration from Porsche's rare 914-6 model, which competed at coveted events such as the 24 hour Le Mans Race, Targo Floria, and many others. To achieve the best performance possible, the car was upgraded to that of a powerful 3.0 L CIS fuel-injected 911 6 cylinder engine, equipped with Mahle high compression pistons—emitting an impressive 180+ braking horsepower, along with an 11-blade cooling fan. The Targa's drive train has also been upgraded to that of a Carrera 915 transmission, including a WEVO side shifter kit and Wave Track LSD differential. The car's chassis were strengthened with the correct welded in reinforcement kit to handle the extra power of the upgraded engine. The longitudinal members were welded for extra strength, and to reduce body flexing. Finishing off the Porsche are stainless steel headers, and a stainless steel Dansk sport muffler. The Porsche comes in a spirited color combination of Yellow with a beautifully finished, full leather, Black interior. You can really feel the power of this Targa as you navigate roads and highways behind a Momo steering wheel while listening to your favorite music over a high quality Blaupunkt stereo system. With increasing global demand for rare, classic, and unique Porsche models, this upgraded 914 stands as an excellent choice for the Porsche enthusiast seeking a truly, one-of-a-kind and fully restored Targa that is simply unmatched in performance, style, and comfort.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> The Porsche 914 was introduced in September 1969 as a collaborative effort between Porsche and Volkswagen to produce a sporty car. The car they came up with was a mid-engined vehicle with seating for two and featured a targa top. A 4-cylinder boxer engine provided the power. Volkswagen needed a vehicle to replace the aging Karmann-Ghia while Porsche was looking for another option to add to their line up. The car sits low and the suspension was a combination of a 911-type torsion bar front suspension with a rear coil spring suspension. The headlights hide in the hood and pop-up when needed. The targa top can be stored in the trunk. The 914/6 was short lived, with only 3360 examples produced between 1970 and 1972. It was raced using different engine configurations.</p><p><strong>For more pictures and further information on this vehicle, please visit:</strong> <a href=""http://classicshowcase.com/index.php/inventory/detail/424"">http://classicshowcase.com/index.php/inventory/detail/424</a></p><p><strong>View the rest of our exansive inventory of classic cars, motorcycles, and boats at:</strong> <a href=""http://classicshowcase.com/index.php/inventory"">http://classicshowcase.com/index.php/inventory</a></p>             <p>              negotiable               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

As the last of the air-cooled 911s  they are the most developed of the original formula that first appeared in 1963. The layout of the instruments  the sheetmetal of the door  and the entire greenhouse is fundamentally unchanged from the original 911  and these cars have a feeling of solidity and craftsmanship that was not only missing from the 996 generation that replaced the 993  but is missing from almost every car made in the last 20 years.<br><br>Yet despite this old-world craftsmanship and the occasional sign that the fundamental architecture dates back to the 1960s  the 993 is impressively modern  even 25 years after its introduction. The sophisticated multilink rear suspension and massive rear tires make the rear placement of the engine a non-issue  while the twin plug 3.6 liter flat-6 is a torquey high-performance unit that is both tractable and full of character. The brakes  always a Porsche strong suit  are superb  and the gearbox is Porsche's robust 6-speed G50 unit. Sophisticated and high performing but also capturing the essence of the original 911  the 993 is the best of both worlds. 993s are true classics that can be driven and enjoyed daily in modern traffic.<br><br>The 993 was available in a variety of forms  with naturally-aspirated and turbocharged engines  rear and four wheel drive  tiptronic or manual transmissions  wide and narrow bodies  and in open and closed forms. The Carrera Coupe combined the clean profile and naturally-aspirated 3.6 liter twin plug flat-six backed by a 6-speed manual transmission with the clean and pure lines of the classic 911 profile  creating the purist's choice in the 911 line. <br><br>This particular 6-speed 993 coupe is a truly spectacular example. Superb in every respect  it would be difficult to imagine a finer example. It has exceptionally low mileage  is exhaustively documented  is extremely complete  and retains all its original paint. Sold new on 5 May 1997 by the legendary Porsche dealer Vasek Polak  this car retains its original license plate frames  paper plates  and original 3V California license plates. Also included with the car is a Vasek Polak envelope containing documents from the car's original purchase: the original purchase invoice  due bill  odometer statement  agreement to furnish insurance  and the business cards of both the salesman who sold the car new and Vasek Polak's sales manager. <br><br>The original window sticker is also in the car's file  along with Certificate of Authenticity  which indicates that this car's MSRP was $68 484 and was equipped with the following options:<br>US Standard Emissions<br>17” Pressure Cast Light Alloy Wheels<br>4 Rim Caps w/Porsche Crest<br>HiFi Sound System<br>Porsche Floor Mats – Black<br>AM/FM Radio w/CD Player<br>Power Seats Package<br>Michelin Tires<br><br>The car's first owner was a resident of Palos Verdes Estates and retained the car for nearly 20 years  fastidiously servicing the car rather than allowing it to develop “sit-itis.” He was extraordinarily preservation-minded  going as far as to remove the original wheels and tires and replace them with an identical brand new set in order to preserve the original ones. The included service records show routine maintenance throughout the car's life  including new tires in 2013 and regular fluid changes  including a service 200 miles ago in May of 2016 which included an oil and filter change  transmission oil change  brake fluid flush  all new belts  updated pulleys  and replacement of cracked bolster end caps and wiper bump stop. The car remains essentially as new with updated LED front turn signals  and HID headlights (factory optional but installed later). Since the original purchaser  this car has had two subsequent owners  both in Northern California  making this a lifelong California car.<br><br>Today  this Porsche presents beautifully with original factory Guards Red paint that is exceptionally well-preserved and glossy throughout. This wonderfully maintained Porsche has been so carefully used  one is hard pressed to detect even mild evidence of road wear on the car. There are a few chips from road use which have been touched up  but the paint is otherwise superb. The body is in excellent condition  showing excellent factory door  trunk  and hood gaps  exceptional fit along the front and rear bumpers  with superb trim  excellent lenses  and original factory glass. The paint meters even and thin and the wheels are in near new condition with no curb rash and beautiful silver finish accenting the Guards Red body and color crests adorning the wheel center caps. The overall look and feel of this car is all the more dramatic  with the contrasting signature 911 profile rendered in the quintessential shade of bright red. It is difficult to convey just how spectacular the cosmetic condition of this example is  but it is truly exceptional.<br><br>The original interior shows virtually no wear  with excellent leather seat upholstery and leatherette finishes throughout the interior. The door panels  including door pulls and door pocket lids are also in essentially new condition. The center console features the original CDR-220 radio and of course  the 6-speed gearshift: a legendary and now rare hallmark of Porsche performance cars. The carpeting is basically unworn and the optional floor mats remain in very nice condition as well.  The dashboard  gorgeous instruments  and center console are all in near new condition with all switches and functions operating as expected. The headliner  sun visors  and control surfaces are all uniformly crisp and near new in their presentation. The overall fit and finish of the interior is fresh  cohesive  and exhibits all the traits of a properly stored and minimally used car. <br><br>The engine compartment and trunk are both unmodified and in extraordinarily nice condition. The original engine is absolutely correct and properly maintained offering more torque and power than the early 993 motors without Varioram. The trunk is  once again  as new  offering exceptionally fine original materials and factory finishes and proving that the trunk carpets of the 993 did in fact once look new. The crisp presentation continues underneath the carpets   including the collapsible spare tire (never used)  proper black molded components  factory treated metal parts  and correct hardware. <br><br>The car starts instantly and the clutch and gearbox work in perfect harmony  owing in part to the low miles and constant care that has been afforded to this exceptional car. The motor provides a wonderful induction roar and pulls cleanly and crisply throughout the rev range.. The suspension has the wonderfully-talkative 911 character  while the brakes offer a firm pedal and remain some the easiest to modulate and most intuitive ever fitted to a road car. The chassis is composed  tight  and authentic  showing no evidence of structural compromise when inspecting the underside and retaining undisturbed factory-applied Cosmoline throughout. <br><br>The car comes with a complete set of factory books  owner's manual  3 original keys  factory compressor  tool roll with tools  and factory jack. The car is also accompanied by original 3V California license plates (front and rear)  the original Cup II 17” wheels and tires  an extra set of exhaust tips  and misc. spare parts removed form the car during service (hood struts  belts  and airbox cover). Documentation includes the original window sticker  purchase papers  salesman's business card  purchase invoice  and other assorted documents. For anyone seeking a time capsule of performance delight and captivating lineage  this exceptional car truly exceeds even the most particular enthusiast's expectations. <br><br>This is a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional car. Not only is the mechanical and cosmetic condition of this low-mileage car exemplary  its provenance and documentation simply could not be finer. Sold by a legendary dealer that is now defunct and complete with a plethora of supporting documentation from that dealer  this car has remained in California its entire life and has a comprehensive paper trail. Truly a preservation grade example of purist's pick of Porsche's last air-cooled 911  this car will delight the most demanding collector who appreciates the very best.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$118,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

The interior and engine bay are clean and tidy. The clutch and battery are new, and fluids are fresh. The tires are new Michelin Pilot Sports. The air con blows cold and there are no thrown codes or drivability issues. Clean CarFax and documented receipts. I would not hesitate to drive this car cross-country or on the track.**********************************************The 993 series was the last of the Porsches with air cooled motors. The 993 added the first 6 speed trans and multilink rear suspension in a 911 (alleviating snap throttle oversteer), and borrowed styling cues from the 959 supercar. The 95 model has become increasingly sought after as it doesn’t have the expensive engine complexities of the later 993 cars, such as the VarioRam intake system or the SAI head ports which are prone to carbon build up. This 1995 993 is exempt from emissions testing (and the hassles of compliance) and only requires a safety inspection, as OBD2 was introduced in the Carrera during the following year. Whenever a Porsche specialist has encountered this car, inevitably their reaction is “That’s the one to get!”.             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$52,750 None               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

The 928 produced from 1978 to 1995 was originally intended to be Porsche""??s flagship model over the 911. The thought was to combine the high performance of a sports car with the refinement of a luxury sedan in a market where regulations were becoming increasingly stringent. Interestingly the 928 was the only V8 powered coupe ever produced by Porsche making for a very special car. This numbers matching 928 S4 is powered by a 5.0L V8 that is estimated about 316hp from the factory. This is mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. This engine packs quite a punch and the transmission shifts smoothly. The ride in this grand tourer is sporty enough for the most discerning driver yet sophisticated enough for the pickiest of passengers. The 928 S4 has remarkable handling and cornering capabilities. This sports coupe is in excellent condition thanks to the meticulous maintenance work the current owner has had performed. Some of the work recently performed in spelled out in the maintenance records provided by the owner. This Porsche presents itself beautifully and you can tell that someone went through the car with a fine-tooth comb. The Blue Leather interior and matching blue carpet and dash of this 928 looks impeccable. It is well sorted and extremely clean. The exterior of this Venetian Blue Porsche shows very well. The highly desirable blue on blue color combination works perfectly on this car. Whether you are looking for a Grand Touring car for road trips a sporty daily driver or a fun Sunday ride you""??ve found the Porsche for you!

There aren't many sports cars that have been around as long as the 911, and none that have stayed as true to the original's formula. At the same time, Porsche has managed to transform the 911 into a modern sports car with the performance and amenities buyers expect. It's an icon of the sports car world, and this pristine example will make an excellent addition to any garage.This car impresses with its refined styling and athletic handling, with strong road grip and minimal body lean. The Carrera's acceleration is particularly impressive -- a result of its direct-injected 3.4L flat-six, rated at an impressive 350HP and paired with Porsche's silky-smooth 7-speed manual transmission. The Power Steering Plus system is very responsive and precise, and the race-bred Porsche brakes provide the required stopping power.The Porsche Carrera has earned a cult-like following and are highly desirable 911 variants, as they combine the best parts of the 911 range. The cockpit of this Porsche maintains basic design themes from the past but boasts cleaner layouts and enhanced functionality, particularly the classic instrument cluster that includes a high resolution, multi-function screen, a central rev counter, and an ignition lock to the left of the steering wheel. Though the cabin has a function-oriented layout, upscale materials on the doors and dashboard, and remarkable craftsmanship and attention to detail throughout welcomes both driver and passenger. The Platinum Grey seats in front are firmly bolstered and deeply contoured, and are in like-new condition, offering miles of comfortable driving.For more information on this fabulous 2013 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe or any of our 40+ Porsches always in stock, contact our friendly and knowledgeable sales team or feel free to drop by our Bellevue, WA showroom - Home of the West Coast's Most Exciting Inventory of Luxury, Exotic, High Performance and Collectible Automobiles.

Verified with a paint meter, all panels wear the original factory sprayed Irish Green paint which is in incredible condition. The car is a matching numbers California car. The car was sold new at Gus Mozart Porsche in Palo Alto, California. The original owner enjoyed the car for 28 years and serviced it regularly. Coincidentally the current owner saw the car nearly 25 years ago in the original owners garage! However, at this time he wasn't looking for a 69E nor was it for sale. A couple years pass and the car is sold to the second owner, a collector, on Feb 11, 1997. Realizing how wonderfully preserved the car had been for the past 30 years, the second owner kept the car in his collection in a climate controlled garage. In 2016 it was sold to the same guy who spotted it in the garage some 25 years ago. It's amazing how these cars seem to float in and out of our lives popping up when you least expect it.</p><p>The car has been maintained meticulously by all three owners over the years. The original paint is in incredible shape however in a few areas it is thinning and there are some small rust bubbles on the passenger side fender. You can see how the care for this car has accumulated over the years into a wonderfully preserved time capsule. Recently, a complete service was performed including turbo tensioners and a new clutch. Mechanically the car is very good, one modification was performed in order to improve the ride quality by replacing the hydropneumatic shocks with torsion bars, a very common suspension modification for the 911E. The car has 139,000 miles on its original engine. The car has some unique dealer installed options including; black leather sports seats, fog lights and a rear wiper. Overall the car is of a preservation class quality and drives like it should. </p><p>Asking $149,500</p><p>For more information regarding this vehicle, please call Henk Baars +1 562 331 0681</p><p>To further accommodate our international clients we can provide world wide shipping at owner's expense.

Porsche originally needed to produce the car in order to comply with homologation regulations and had intended on marketing it as a street legal race vehicle like the 1973 Carrera 2.7 RS. The FIA's Appendix ''J'' rules that brought about the 911 Turbo Carrera RSR 2.1 in 1974 changed in 1975 and 1976. The FIA announced that cars for Group 4 and Group 5 had to look like production cars and would be for ''Normal Sale'' with a means the distribution of cars to individual purchasers through normal channels of the manufacture. For the 1976 season, new FIA regulations required manufactures to produce 400 cars in twenty-four months to gain approval for Group 4. Group 5 would require the car to be derived from a homologated model in Group 3 or 4. To win the Group 5 Championship, Porsche would first have to have a car that could compete in Group 4 which led to the 934. For Group 5, Porsche would create one of the most successful racing cars of all time, the 935. While the original purpose of the Porsche Turbo was to gain homologation for the 1976 racing season, the marketing department soon awoke to the potential of this ultra high-performing machine when the original target of 400 cars was passed by the end of 1975. Since Porsche wanted to be racing for the 1976 season, they gained FIA homologation for the Porsche Turbo for Group 4 in Nr. 645 on 6 Dec '75 after they certified that 400 identical production cars had been completed. The 1,000th 1976 Turbo was completed on 5 May '76 and this production number allowed Porsche reclassify the Turbo for Group 3, series-production grand touring car in FIA Homologation Nr. 3076, 1 Jan '77. Additional variants to Group 4 (and Group 5) were promulgated in Nr. 3076 and included the 1977 model year (chassis nr. 9307700001, 1 Jan '77) and the 3.3 liter Turbo (chassis nr. 9308700001, 1 Jan '78). FIA Nr. 3076 remained in effect until replaced by FIA B-208 in 1 Mar 1982 for Group A/B when the homologation designation was changed from ''Porsche Turbo'' to ''911 Turbo''.</p> <p>Ferdinand ''Ferry'' Porsche, who was running the company at the time, handed development of the vehicle over to Ernst Fuhrmann, who adapted the turbo-technology originally developed for the 917/30 CAN-AM car to the 3.0 litre flat-six from the Carrera RS 3.0, creating what Porsche internally dubbed project 930.  Total output from the engine was 260bhp, much more than the standard Carrera. In order to ensure that the platform could make the most of the higher power output, a revised suspension, larger brakes and stronger gearbox became part of the package, although some consumers were unhappy with Porsche's use of a 4-speed whilst a 5-speed manual was available in the ''lesser'' Carrera. A ''whale tail'' rear spoiler was installed to help vent more air to the engine and help create more downforce at the rear of the vehicle, and wider rear wheels with upgraded tires combined with flared wheelarches were added to increase the 911's width and grip, making it more stable.</p> <p>Early Development and Production:<br> Porsche badged their new vehicle simply as ''Turbo'' (although early U.S. units were badged as ''Turbo Carrera'') and debuted it at the Paris Auto Show in October 1974 before putting it on sale in the spring of 1975; export to the United States began shortly thereafter in 1976.  The 930 proved very fast but also very demanding.  It was initially rone by its short wheelbase and rear engine layout to oversteer and significant turbo-lag.  Porsche made its first and most significant upgrades to the 930 for 1978, enlarging the engine to 3.3 liters and adding an air-to-air intercooler. By cooling the pressurized air charge, the intercooler helped increase power output to 300bhp and the rear 'whale tail' spoiler was re-profiled and raised slightly to make room for the intercooler. Porsche also upgraded the brakes to units similar to those used on their all conquering 917.</p> <p>Changing emissions regulations in Japan and the U.S. forced Porsche to withdraw the 930 from both of those markets in 1980. It remained, however, available in Canada. Believing the luxurious 928 gran turismo would eventually replace the 911 as the top of the Porsche line, Fuhrmann cut-back spending on the model, and it was not until Fuhrmann's resignation that the company finally committed the financing to re-regulate the car for the very popular US, Canadian and Japanese markets.  Prior to this, the 930 remained available in Europe, and for 1983 a 330bhp performance option became available on a build-to-order basis from Porsche. With the add-on came a 4-pipe exhaust system and an additional oil-cooler requiring a re-modelled front spoiler and units bearing the add-on often featured additional ventilation holes in the rear fenders and modified rockers.</p> <p>Legendary ''Flachbau'' (''Slant-Nose'') Option Package:<br> Porsche offered a ''Flachbau'' (''Slant-Nose'') 930 under their ''Sonderwunschprogramm'' (special wish program) beginning in 1981, an otherwise normal 930 with a 935-style slantnose instead of the normal 911 front end. Each Flachbau unit was handcrafted by remodeling the front fenders. So few were built that the slantnose units often commanded a high premium price, adding to the fact that they required a initial premium of up to 60 per cent (highly individualized cars even more) over the standard price. (Today, most sources claim the Factory built 948 of these special ''Flachbau'' units.) Those examples so completed usually delivered in Europe most often also featured the 330bhp performance kit.</p> <p>By the 1985 model year, 928 sales had risen slightly, but questions remained whether it would supersede the 911 as the company's premier model. Porsche re-introduced the 930 to the Japanese and U.S. markets in 1986 with an emission-controlled engine producing 282bhp. At the same time Porsche introduced Targa and Cabriolet variants, both of which proved popular in a variety of markets, especially in the States.  Porsche discontinued the 930 after model year 1989 when its underlying ''G-Series'' platform was being replaced by the 964. '89 models were the first and last versions of the 930 to feature the G50 transmission, a 5-speed manual transmission. A turbo version of the 964 officially succeeded the 930 in 1991 but it was essentially a modified version of the same 3.3 litre flat-6 engine and a 5-speed transmission.</p> <p>VIN WP0JB0938JS050193:<br> This particular 930 Turbo was special ordered in July of 1987 and completed in September of 1987.  It was the 182nd North American Market example completed for ''Model Year 1988'' and it was one of only 278 ''Flachbau'' Slant-Nose examples completed.  The original order and subsequent completion of the vehicle saw it being fitted with a long list of the most desirable options then available for Porsche's ''Flagship'' vehicle.  These include the following:</p> <p>-M018  Sports Steering Wheel with Elevated Hub<br> -M139  Driver's Side Heated Seat<br> -M158  Special Blaupunkt Multi-Channel Stereo Cassete Radio<br> -M220  Special ''Self-Locking'' Differential (40% Limited-Slip)<br> -M340  Passenger Side Heated Seat<br> -M505  Special Coachwork, North American Market ''Slant-Nose'' Front End<br> -M533  Anti-Theft / Visual Deterrent Alarm System<br> -M650  Electronically Activated Sunroof</p> <p>Porsche no longer provides original KARDEX records or the later Data Assembly Sheets for the vehicles they completed but due to the incredible originality and un-molested nature of this particular example, hidden under the front body panel is Porsche's original glued-on paper internal production-line assembly code data sheet.  This confirms by the vehicle's original VIN number all of the original special ordered option codes and features as shown above.</p> <p>Porsche completed fewer than 1,000 M505 Flachbau / Slant-Nose 930 Turbos before canceling the option package in 1989.  Today these are the rarest and most sought after examples due to the highly desirable styling and rarity of the design.  This 930 Turbo lived a charmed and utterly pampered life from the moment it was special ordered up to the present.  It was painstakingly preserved and conserved by the original owner, never being driven in the wet and very careful attention was given when cleaning not to damage the original paint, trim and finish of the vehicle.  The original owner reluctantly sold the car to noted South-Florida Porsche enthusiast and collector, Victor Gomez it remained in his care and continued to be carefully preserved until 2007 when he was offered a price he simply could not refuse and parted with the vehicle.  The next owner likewise continued a no-expense spared program of care and attention with a careful eye on ''conservation &amp; preservation'' at all times.  As a result this Porsche with nothing more than a gentle wipe down scored several impressive first place finishes at various Porsche Club North America meets where it was the darling of the preservation class.</p> <p>This 930 Turbo has just been carefully serviced and fully safety checked with no additional running time since this work was completed.  It is sold with full records, history, award documentation and a large portfolio of service records and receipts.  All of the original delivery items, owner's manuals, tool kit, factory air compressor, period sales brochures, and a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity are also included.  This vehicle is also equipped with a rare Factory limited-slip differential, electric sliding sunroof, heated seats, and a raised leather-covered steering wheel.  A period-correct Alpine CD player is currently installed but the original and very rare stock Blaupunkt cassette player also comes with the car.</p>             <p>                            <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

The 964 development program began in 1986 and production commenced at the end of 1989 and ended in 1994 when the new 993 model was introduced.  At the very end of 964 production, Porsche pulled the final 90 Turbo models from the regular assembly line for transformation into the rarest 911 variants ever built by the Factory.</p> <p>All 90 were all transferred to ''Porsche Exclusiv'' and built as the very special Turbo 3.6S.  The Turbo 3.6S was available either with the traditional 964 Turbo 3.6 body, or with the ''Exclusive'' flachbau or ''slant nose'' option.</p> <p>The optioned designation for these unique machines denoted what market they would be built and sold to, X83 (Japanese market), X84 (ROW) and X85 (USA market.)  The Turbo S Flachbau, was available in the US as a separate $60,179 option on top of the base price $99,000.  Similar pricing for the upgrade was available in Europe as well as in Japan.  39 Models were made for US markets, 27 for the Rest of the world, and just 10 for Japan.  A wide variety of options were available for individual client choosing ensuring that no two examples were the same.</p> <p>The X83 models all featured the 930 Turbo S/944 style front end with hooded pop up type headlights, 930 style rear quarter vents and boxed rockers.  All were built as left-hand-drive exclusion/exception models in Polar Silver Metallic and featured the exact same basic build code specifications.

The 3.6 liter powered Turbo was produced only for the 1994 model year, with fewer than 1,500 of them produced in total, making it one of the rarest and most sought after Porsches produced since the 959.</p> <p>Porsche 964 Turbo 3.6 VIN: WPOAC2968RS4800062: <br> This particular Turbo 3.6 was ordered and purchased new by Mr. Michael Wekerle of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada The special order had been placed earlier that year on his behalf by Heimreth Porsche Services Ltd., of Scarborough, Ontario. The order requested:</p> <p>-One Turbo 3.6, with black exterior and interior with Canadian equipment and emissions as well as many other standard and special features noted above.</p> <p>The vehicle was sold and delivered to him new on September 30th, 1993 at which time the odometer showed just 4 kilometers. This Porsche remained with Mr. Wekerle until being bought in 2003 by Dr. Ian Ross of Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Canadian Registration records indicate recorded mileage as of March 20th, 2001 was 35,801 kilometers and 49,771 kilometers on November 7th, 2005. On March 31st, 2010 the car was registered to the third owner, Mr. Farhang Markvandi of Ottawa, Ontario. Canadian registration records confirm that this Porsche had covered 53,250 kilometers at this time.</p> <p>Mr. Markvandi in addition to his home in Ottawa, also had homes in Pooler and Tybee, Georgia, USA. In the Summer of 2010, Mr. Markvandi had this Porsche shipped to him in Georgia where he enjoyed and serviced it until bringing it back to Canada in the Spring of 2013. Shortly thereafter he sold the car to the world-famous Porsche collector and racer, Kevin Ma who had homes and businesses in both Burnaby, British Columbia and Blaine, Washington. Mr. Ma retained this Porsche until February of 2015 when it was purchased by dealers, SR Auto Group of Vancouver, BC, they intern sold it to fellow Canadian dealers, Silver Arrows Performance Cars Ltd., also of Vancouver, BC in June of 2015. They had the vehicle issued an official odometer statement confirming that the odometer had legally been coveted from kilometers to miles per our and it now indicated 60,164 total miles.</p> <p>In august of 2015, Symbolic International was asked to source an original 964 Turbo 3.6 for a valued client and this particular Porsche was selected due to the extensive and detailed records as well as clean and accident free history. A Canadian CarProof Claims Report, the equivalent of a CARFAX here in the States was provided which indicated no discrepancies, accidents, damage or insurance claims on the vehicle. The clean CarProof Claims Report and a massive documentation album with records and receipts going back to new was further provided by Silver Arrow Performance Cars and it remains with this vehicle to this day.</p> <p>WPOAC2968RS4800062 Today: <br> This rare and highly desirable, one-year-only model Porsche 964 Turbo 3.6 has covered just 37 miles since the completion of full services, safety checks and maintenance programs. It is sold completely rust and accident free with all original delivery equipment book, manuals and tools as delivered new. It remains pristine in all regards and essentially still showroom new despite now being 23 years old and having covered just over 60,000 miles.

The build started with a 1965 Polo Red Porsche 911 Coupe which had been restored in years past. Although an older restoration, the car looks great with only minor imperfections making it a perfect contender for a tribute build. We have completed the following; refreshed the front/rear suspension with new bushings, fresh powder coating, new rotors, new brakes, brake master cylinder etc. We are currently in the process of rebuilding the engine. We had the original seats recovered in black leatherette with black/red pepita inserts and installed the rear decklid, hood and fog lights. We have also installed the hood and decklid badges which are made of a high quality aluminum backing and bolted on just as they did in 1965. We also sourced period correct Marchal fog lights. A new headliner, new rubber seals/gaskets etc. were all installed during the past restoration. The car has the original correct Solex Carburetors. Our goal for this build was to create an authentic representation of the original 65 Monte Carlo car. *Peter Falk and Herbert Linge will not be included with purchase.

As the last of the air-cooled 911s  they are the most developed of the original formula that first appeared in 1963. The layout of the instruments  the sheetmetal of the door  and the entire greenhouse is fundamentally unchanged from the original 911  and these cars have a feeling of solidity and craftsmanship that was not only missing from the 996 generation that replaced the 993  but is missing from almost every car made in the last 20 years.<br><br>Yet despite this old-world craftsmanship and the occasional sign that the fundamental architecture dates back to the 1960s  the 993 is impressively modern  even 25 years after its introduction. The sophisticated multilink rear suspension and massive rear tires make the rear placement of the engine a non-issue  while the twin plug 3.6 liter flat-6 is a torquey high-performance unit that is both tractable and full of character. The brakes  always a Porsche strong suit  are superb  and the gearbox is Porsche's robust 6-speed G50 unit. Sophisticated and high performing but also capturing the essence of the original 911  the 993 is the best of both worlds. 993s are true classics that can be driven and enjoyed daily in modern traffic.<br><br>The 993 was available in a variety of forms  with naturally-aspirated and turbocharged engines  rear and four wheel drive  wide and narrow bodies  and in open and closed forms. Among the most collectible variants  the Carrera S combined the clean profile and naturally-aspirated 3.6 liter twin plug flat six of the Carrera with the widened flares of the Twin Turbo. The Carrera S is an aggressive yet beautiful car with tremendous presence  and is the most sought-after and valuable naturally-aspirated 993 that was available in North America.<br><br>According to the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity  this particular Carrera S was delivered from the factory with the widebody configuration and the following factory options:<br><br>US Emissions<br>Tiptronic Transmission<br>AM/FM Stereo with CD Player<br>Digital Sound Package<br>18” Wheels<br>Supple Leather<br>Carbon Fiber Package<br>Carbon Shifter &amp; Brake Handle<br>Aluminum Instrument Dials<br>Stainless Steel Door Entrance Panels<br>Stainless Steel Exhaust Pipes<br><br>The current owner purchased the car in 1998 with just 12 000 miles indicated on the odometer. Over the past 20 years of careful ownership  the dealer service log book shows proper servicing and miles  including Porsche service records from Calrsen Motor Cars the car was serviced with 48 867 miles including a $1 400.00 6 year service  $1 800 brake service with new discs and pads  and a $300.00 transmission service. With just 55 000 miles currently showing on the odometer  a 60 000 miles service was performed on the car recently. <br><br>Today  this Porsche presents beautifully with original factory Glacier White paint that is exceptionally well preserved and glossy throughout. The wide body offered with the S trim is particularly stunning  giving the car a clean and dynamic presence especially in Glacier White. The front bumper cap has been professionally repainted due to light rock chips and a small portion of the right rear fender properly blended in when the owner scuffed it against his motorcycle side bags while parking in his garage. There are two very small scratches located along the rear passenger fender lip and one on the front left fender lip. Other than these small items  the paintwork of this wonderfully maintained Porsche is difficult to fault. The body is in excellent condition showing excellent gaps and fit throughout. The lights and lenses are in very nice shape  as is the factory glass. The turbo twist wheels are similarly nice  with no major marks or curb rash.<br><br>The original interior shows beautifully overall  with minor wear to the supple leather on the driver's seat  but very little other indicates of wear or age. The car has the full leather option  which includes door pulls  door pocket lids  and both upper and lower dashboard  all of which are in excellent order. The center console features the original radio and Tiptronic gearshift  along with the handsome and sporty carbon fiber treatment. The carpeting  headliner  and sun visors are all very nicely preserved.  The dashboard  gorgeous instruments with optional aluminum faces  and center console are all in near new condition with all switches and functions operating as expected. The remaining interior surfaces are all uniformly crisp and near new in their presentation. The steering wheel with the unique carbon fiber inserts remains in very nice. The overall fit and finish of the interior is fresh  cohesive  and exhibits all the traits of a properly stored but enjoyably used car. <br><br>The engine compartment and trunk are both unmodified and in extraordinarily nice condition. The original engine is absolutely correct and tidy  offering more torque and power than the early 993 motors. The trunk is  once again  is in near new condition  presenting exceptionally fine original materials and factory finishes including the collapsible spare tire  proper black molded components  factory treated metal parts  and correct hardware.  <br><br>The car starts instantly with the Tiptronic functioning smoothly and without hesitation  owing in part to the low miles  recent transmission service  and continual care afforded on this beautiful car. The motor provides a wonderful induction roar resulting in genuinely remarkable performance  even by modern standards. The world class suspension delivers that wonderfully-talkative 911 character  while the brakes offer a firm pedal and remain some the easiest to modulate and most intuitive ever fitted to a roadcar. The chassis is composed and tight  showing no evidence of structural compromise when inspecting the underside. The car comes with a complete set of factory books  owner's manual  original keys  factory compressor  tool roll with tools  and factory jack. Documentation includes a copy of the Porsche COA and service receipts. <br><br>This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a low mileage  well maintained and very unusually optioned 993 Carrera S. Presented in exceptional cosmetic condition with one owner for the last 20 years  this Porsche 911 Carrera S Coupe is ready for enjoyable touring  spirited driving  and genuine admiration as the last of the great air-cooled engineering performance and design marvels of the 20th century.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$85,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Besides oil changes, the only repair was a clutch vacuum which was done pre- emptively. The car is riding on brand new tires all around and comes with both the original rims and the specialty TechArt black rims.</p><p>The car has no accidents and the current owner and prior owner have no knowledge of any paintwork/accident repairs. </p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$58,500 obo               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

The car was, quite simply, the prettiest early Turbo I'd ever seen and it took me several weeks and a huge check to convince the long-time owner to sell it to me.</p><p>Prior to my purchase the car had a total of four previous owners which are documented in the original owner's manual including their names and addresses (with the exception of the 2nd owner) and with the mileage documented each time the car changed hands. The gentleman who sold me the car had owned the car for nearly 15 years and kept meticulous records during his ownership that will be included with the sale. When I acquired the car, the mileage stood at 42,705 miles. Under my care, the car has been driven sparingly and today the mileage stands at 43,024 original miles. </p><p>The car is stunning in its original Ice Green Metallic paint over Color-to-Sample leather interior and is well-optioned with sport seats and a sunroof. It shows beautifully and exhibits numerous details only seen in the most correct and original cars including:</p><ul><li>Original, dealer-stamped, owner's manual.</li><li>Original toolkit and jack</li><li>Original windshield with correct Porsche, Sigla and Made in W. Germany markings</li><li>Original, 72-dated Bosch taillight lenses</li><li>Original power antenna</li><li>Original, correctly dated Fuchs wheels</li><li>Original, correctly dated spare tire</li><li>The correct and working Bamberg radio</li></ul><p>The outstanding originality of this car was recognized in 2005 when it won first place in its preservation class at the 50th Annual Porsche Parade Concours d'Elegance. A photo of the car on the winner's stand, as well as the official scoring record and award results, will be provided to the new owner.</p><p>While I'm an avid car-guy, I'm not a dealer. This car is part of my personal collection and under my care it received regular and careful service as does every car I own. It is offered for sale today only because I own dozens of vintage Porsches, with more on the way, and I need to make some room. In my opinion, this car is one of the finest '76 Turbos available anywhere. I would not hesitate to drive this car across the country tomorrow. Along the way, I'd stop by a few tracks just for fun and I'd do my best to find and enter a local car show (which I would easily win). The car is just that good.</p><p>Following is more detailed information.</p><p><strong>Mechanicals:</strong><br>The car starts, stops and drives exactly as you would expect from a car of this quality. The clutch is strong, the car brakes easily and in a straight line, and it runs cool with excellent oil pressure even in the 100+ degree, Texas summer heat. It accelerates with authority courtesy of its legendary, turbocharged motor and the transmission shifts flawlessly making this car truly a joy to drive. The engine and transmission are, of course, numbers matching and original to the car.</p><p>In 2001 the brakes were upgraded to the Porsche ""Big Red"" brakes - a common upgrade for early Turbos - and done at significant expense. The work is fully documented and the original brake components were preserved and will be provided to the new owner.</p><p>Other than the brakes, the car is a case-study in originality and, as you might expect, the mechanical needs under my ownership were minimal.</p><p>In 2015, I had both of the original fuel pumps rebuilt by the professionals at Fuel Injection Corporation in Tracy, CA. It would have been easier and less expensive to install later style fuel pumps in the car but I just couldn't bring myself to do it on a car this original.</p><p>Recently (less than 100 miles ago) the car was brought to Steve Henry at Eagle Racing in Dripping Springs, TX for a full service. In addition to the standard service items, Steve also adjusted the valves, replaced a leaking oil line, replaced both CV joints, performed a 4-wheel alignment and installed a brand new set of Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R Tires.</p><p>The end result? Everything you would imagine. And more. This mechanical condition of the car will not disappoint.</p><p>Please note: The air conditioning has not been charged under my ownership. I generally drive the car in the fall/winter months so I haven't bothered to look at it (a common excuse when you own more than 60 cars). The new owner should assume the AC system will require service.</p><p><strong>Exterior:</strong><br>From every angle, the car presents beautifully in its factory color of Ice Green Metallic (paint code 266). The paint is perhaps the finest original paint I have ever seen - glossy and smooth and appearing closer to 40 days old than 40 years. The paint has been professionally metered and shows consistent readings for depth and from panel to opposing panel (please see photos). As with any 40+ year old car, it's possible that the car received some minor touch ups over the years but the car shows no signs of having been repainted and will easily meet any ""original paint"" conditions for survivor or preservation class competitions. There are two small areas of wear: some light scratches on a small area of the sunroof and some checking on the original fiberglass whale tail. Both are shown in the photo gallery, neither distracts from the overall beauty of the car, and, if anything, each simply adds to and comfirms the outstanding originality of the paintwork. </p><p>The glass on the car is excellent and all original with correct markings. </p><p>The trim, seals, emblems, and lenses are all near-flawless.</p><p>The wheels are beautiful showing only the slightest patina. </p><p>Best of all, the Ice Green Metallic paint really sets this car apart. Only a small number of 930's were produced in this color and you'll most likely never see another (certainly never with original paint). This car creates a scene wherever it goes and the photos truly do not do this car justice.</p><p><strong>Interior:</strong><br>The interior of this 930 is absolutely beautiful and exactly what you'd expect from a low-mileage, investment grade car. Upholstered in one-of-a-kind, color-to-sample leather, the effect is a beautiful compliment to the Ice Green Metallic exterior. All aspects of the interior, including the carpets, seats, doors and headliner, are in outstanding condition with only light patina - simply the very best I have ever seen for a car of this vintage.</p><p>When I acquired the car, the single significant flaw was the original leather dash which showed sun damage that could not be repaired. Because the interior was ordered color-to-sample, this posed a unique challenge for which I sought the expertise of the professionals at Relicate Custom Leather in Johnstown, NY. Relicate is perhaps the finest bespoke automotive leather facility in the country, well-known in the vintage Ferrari community, and their color-matching is second to none. They were able to custom dye for me an entire hide with the correct Porsche grain which was then sent to Tony at Autobahn Interiors who professionally recovered the dash for me. The end result was not cheap. But it was worth it and you'll agree when you see it. The remaining leather hide will be provided to the new owner.</p><p>Other than the dash, the interior is 100% original and in stunning condition. Of particular note is the correct Bamberg radio which was recently serviced and sounds great (even the cassette player works). The microphone is located in the driver's footwell pocket, as is correct for 1976 cars, but is not currently plugged in.</p><p>I've taken the time to provide multiple, close-up photos of the interior from every angle. Please examine them closely and pay attention to the details. Yes, the big things like the seats, and door panels all look excellent. But look even more closely at the small things. The interior details of this car are among the best I've ever seen and will exceed your expectations.</p><p>For me, finding the right home for this 930 is as important as getting the best price. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this car in more detail, please feel free to contact me. In-person inspections and test-drives are welcomed and encouraged but please do so before committing to a purchase.</p><p>I have a clear and correct Texas title for this vehicle in my possession. Transportation and delivery of this vehicle is the responsibility of the purchaser. I'll happily assist in any way I can. I'll accept payment by wire transfer, cash or certified cashier's check. </p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$185,000 obo               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Both weight and aerodynamics came under close scrutiny – ultimately, the RS would weigh hundreds of pounds less than a standard 911; and stability and downforce efforts are capped off by the fiberglass front airdam and ducktail competition spoiler, the first one on a production car. </p><p>As spectacular as the body is, even more work went into the powertrain. Extracting additional cubic inches from the stock 2.34-liter flat six was not simple, and required pioneering use of nickel-silicon carbide – Nikasil – cylinder linings, previously only used like this in the Porsche 917. Enabling it to make 210 HP from 2.69 liters, this technology ultimately breathed new life into the entire engine lineup. All Carrera RSs were also built with a Type 915/08 five-speed transmission; disc brakes; reinforced front and rear suspension and seven-millimeter spacers for a wider rear track. Standard equipment included 6Jx15 front and 7Jx15 rear forged aluminum wheels, and stiff Bilstein shocks. The RS was offered in three flavors – a hardcore Racing model; streetable but still ultralight Sport; and the Touring, which brought a more durable steel front bumper in place of fiberglass, and interior equipment closer to a stock 911.</p><p>Number 181 is among the earliest of the Touring models built. Porsche's Certificate of Authenticity confirms it was constructed in the first batch of 500 cars between September and November of 1972, although like most 911 Carrera RS models it is listed as a 1973 on the COA. It was recently restored in Europe by a marque specialist, and is reported to be in excellent condition. Having left the factory in Signal Yellow, it is currently finished in equally eye-catching Orange over a fresh Black leather interior.  </p><p>In 2015 the original engine was located in Sweden with injection system intact and disassembled, rebuilt, installed and tuned by well known Porsche engine specialist Drew Slayton in South Carolina. Furthermore, the original engine's number, 6630191, matches the certificate of authenticity included with the car</p><p> </p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$650,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

A concept so intimate with the road that it can hardly be improved. But it can be intensified thanks to three letters: GTS. Three letters that were adopted for the first time in 1963 with the 904 GTS, a sports car equipped with a mid-mounted engine. Three letters that have since caused a stir among motorsport enthusiasts both on and off the track. Today, they stand for even greater power and an even sportier specification.

Just 2-Owners, 26,000 Miles &amp; All History Known from New<br> A Benchmark 914/6 – Honest &amp;Original Example<br> Lifelong California Car – With Numbers Matching Engine <br> Includes Porsche Certificate of Authenticity &amp; A Dossier of Recorded History<br> One of Only 3,333 914/6s Produced – Ultra Rare &amp; Desirable<br> Complete with All Original Books, Tools, Documentation, Jack &amp; Spare</p> <p>The Porsche 914/6 was a joint development between Porsche and Volkswagen conceived in the late 1960's. The standard 914 was powered by Volkswagen's horizontal four-cylinder engine, even with the lightweight Porsche body, acceleration suffered. The solution was to offer a second version, the 914/6, built by Porsche at the main plant in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. This would be powered by a six-cylinder engine derived from the 1969 911T, along with several other upgrades which further hybridized this ''mid-engined 911''. Despite several impressive victories on the motor racing scene, only 3,333 914/6s were produced – forever influencing the future lineup of Porsche.</p> <p>Completed in October of 1970, 9140432357 was finished as seen here in Canary Yellow over Black Leatherette upholstery with optional equipment including: comfort equipment, Blaupunkt ''Frankfurt'' radio, round white fog lights, tinted glass all-around and light metal wheels. The history known and recorded for this Porsche begins with a correspondence letter between its original owner, Frank Hubbard and a friend in Europe. Being so limited produced, these 914/6s were very difficult to obtain, even in Europe, where dealerships couldn't acquire demonstration vehicles. Pricing was also nearly that of standard 911. Mr. Hubbard eventually purchased this car on December 12, 1970 from Chick Iverson Porsche-Audi in Newport Beach, California.</p> <p>The car was sparingly driven from 1970-1978, but then it was placed in storage until 1990. Mr. Hubbard fell ill in 1990 and was taken in by the same friends in the letter, whom had moved back to the States from Spain. After Hubbard's passing, the car remain in storage until 1995, thereafter, the Porsche was lightly restored cosmetically (commissioned by the Morrisons) and then driven until 1999 when it went back into storage. By 2007, all original mechanical components, gaskets and consumables needed refreshening and the 914/6 made its triumphant return to the road in 2008. A correct, upgraded transmission was also installed at that time, but the original numbers-matching case is included. The car currently displays just 26,600 miles, which is without a doubt original and documented, as well as retains majority original components throughout the vehicle.</p> <p>In addition to its Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, 9140432357 is accompanied by two large dossiers containing documentation and meticulously detailed history from new. Some of the excellent items included are the original owner's manual, VIN-matched maintenance booklet, serial-matched Blaupunkt radio books, original parts catalogs, dealer brochures, factory pricing sheets and more. Furthermore, this 914/6 is complete with jack, tool kit, date matched spare and dogbone foot rest – complimenting the stunningly preserved upholstery.</p> <p>A recent complete service, multi-point inspection and period correct Pirelli CN36 tires, assures continued spirited drivability for this remarkably honest car. Today, the model is highly celebrated as a pioneer of the mid-engined, perfectly balanced Porsche, and this exceptional turn-key 914/6 is now available for worldwide purchase and delivery for our Houston, Texas showroom.</p> <p>$114,500.00 FIRM</p> <p>To learn more about this vehicle, please contact our sales department at (281) 497-1000 or <a data-toggle=""modal"" href=""#myModal"" id=""contact-seller""> [Email Dealer] </a><br> SELLING YOUR CAR?</p> <p>Our Philosophy is Selling Made Simple!

With just 20,500 documented miles, this Carrera remains completely numbers-matching, in stock configuration, including trim upholstery, Blaupunkt Monterey radio and emergency accessories. Matching identification tags are still adhered to the door jambs and underside of the hood, while the undercarriage is nicely detailed, paring well to the engine bay. Recently the Turbo Look received a new dash pad in leather by order of its previous fastidious care taker.</p> <p>The motor, transmission and electronics, operate as expected from such a low mileage and pampered car. The 911 received a thorough mechanical freshening in mid-2015, or about 500+ miles ago with all records on file, along with a December 2017 multi-point inspection, including all new 205/55ZR16 and 225/50ZR Porsche N-Spec, Pirelli P-Zero System Direzionale tires. The Carrera is complemented by its original Owner's Manual, Tool Kit, Jack, date stamped Spare Tire, Airmate Compressor and emergency sunroof crank.</p> <p>The collectability of 3.2 Carreras continues to develop as more enthusiasts value the model's everyday drivability and nostalgia paired with modern amenities. Over the years, many M491 911s were sacrificed as track cars, prized for their bulletproof, naturally aspirated engines paired to aerodynamic bodywork. This already rare wide-bodied example is made even more scare in its incredibly low mileage and unmolested form.

The rules for FIA Group 4 homologation required 400 road cars to be built, which spurred the development of 'Project 930' - the legendary 911/930 Turbo. The turbocharged 3.0 liter engine in road trim developed 260bhp with propelled the Turbo Carrera from and standstill to 100 mph in 14 seconds and resulted in a top speed of 155mph. Porsche's first road going super car, this meant it was on par or faster that its contemporary's in the day, the Aston Martin's V8 Vantage, Ferrari's 512 Berlinetta Boxer and Lamborghini's Countach, certainly excellent company. Legenadry racing driver Paul Frere stated ""It offers the finest blend of ultimate performance and refinement I have ever come across. This is the first year of the Porsche Turbo in the USA and a rare find. This extraordinarily well-restored Turbo Carrera is the 232nd example of 530 car model run for the 1976 Porsche model year. <br><br>The 1976 Porsche 930 Turbo Carrera featured here is finished in classic Platinum Metallic with an impeccably-kept Cinnamon leather interior. This 930 has had the same owner for the past thirty years; a Porsche Club member who meticulously maintained and preserved this motorcar. A comprehensive mechanical refurbishing was performed by a marque specialist less than 300 miles ago which included a complete engine rebuild, new clutch, new Pirelli tires and much more. We are extremely pleased to offer this highly-optioned, fully documented 930 Turbo Carrera to the most particular collector, investor or enthusiast who appreciates low miles and superior condition.

Notable options include a limited slip differential and sport seats, which were replaced with a newer pair of factory, power-adjustable sport seats. </p><p>This two-owner 930 was properly maintained and <strong>retains a factory appearance inside and out</strong> that will delight Porsche enthusiasts. The 15K valve adjustment was recently performed by a Porsche specialist, and every worn seal and hose was replaced with OEM parts. It has a new Duracell battery, new hood struts, and Michelin Pilot Sport tires with less than 1K miles.</p><p>An audiophile-grade stereo system and integrated laser/radar was professionally installed around the same time as the restoration. This 930 was originally ordered radio delete, and the stock blank face plate for the dash is included. A factory driver side mirror was also fitted during the restoration with a power adjustment. The complete original toolkit, spare belts, and a factory Porsche air pump accessory are also present. The A/C is also fully functional.</p><p>The rebuilt flat-six racing engine roars like it should as it inhales giant gulps of exploding dinosaur fuel. A slight improvement in power over stock levels is under foot from a faster-spooling turbo, larger intercooler, and exhaust system that performs better than the original factory equipment.</p><p>There are a few minor stone chips and blemishes noted in the photos that have been carefully touched up. The repaint was done to a high standard in the correct color and shows well for its age. Despite the audio system being from the early 2000's, the sound is impressive by today's standards. </p><p><strong>Porsche produced just 451 930 turbos for USA in 1978.</strong> This model year introduced the intercooled version of the 930 with the whale tale that defined Porsche's first supercar. Not only is the 930 a highly collectable car with an iconic look, but it also has the remarkable history of being the only homologated road car to win the 24hrs of Le Mans outright in 1979 by Porsche Kremer Racing. It was at the head of the pack in its day and the performance still impresses today.</p><p>This 930 is a thrill to drive and show. There are certainly less expensive ones on the market, but the worn out ones will make owners pay a more in time and money later. The vehicle currently resides in southern Oregon and is ready to enjoy. </p><p>Additional vehicle history and details are available by phone or email.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$139,500 negotiable               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

These cars featured a 3.3L air cooled, Turbocharged, Flat 6-cylinder motor with 282HP.  The gearbox is a 4-speed manual and the wheels/brakes were larger than that of a standard 911 with the rear end widened, thus these cars are known as the 930 in Porsche model language.</p><p>This 911 Turbo on offer is part of a local NW Porsche collection and has just benefited from a fresh major service consisting of all fluids, filters, spark plugs, cap, rotor, coil, plug wires, valve adjustment, oil lines, hood struts, fuel injector service, drive belts, AC recharge, and a rebuilding of the original turbo. A compression and leak down test were performed and all cylinders have good results. New proper sized Bridgestone RE-11 tires have just been fitted and the car drives excellent. This 911 is complete with all the original manuals, tool kit, air compressor, collapsable spare tire, optional full tonneau cover, soft top boot, copy of original window sticker, and documented service history from new. Bayside Porsche in Everett, WA sold this Turbo new on April 18th, 1988 and the factory options include; power-heated front sport seats, power soft top, and raised hub steering wheel. The Guards Red paint is in excellent condition and the Black leather interior has not been damaged by the sun or abuse of any kind. The glass is in excellent condition with no chips or scratches and the soft top has no rips, holes, or discoloration of the rear window.

Capt. Patton served on five US nuclear attack submarines, two ballistic-missile submarines, and commanded the USS Pargo before becoming the technical consultant for the film The Hunt for Red October. This car has transported The Captain from base to base since September 5, 1964 when he purchased it new from Annis-Morrill Porsche/VW in Framingham MA.</p><p>The C (Type 6 or T-6), received the last, best, most unbreakable stuff in the development of the 356. Revered, reliable and virtually recession-proof, the most notable changes from previous 356s were disc brakes all around, a first on a road going Porsche, flat hubcaps (required to cover this new technology) and dual air intakes on the engine lid.</p><p>About the restoration. </p><p>We documented that all numbers match on The Captain's car, then we lovingly restored it with no expense spared. Rusted areas were stripped to bare metal and received expert repair — metal replaced and filled without use of lead or plastic fillers. The floor was stripped and recoated in the factory finish. The body was resprayed with Spies-Hecker two-stage urethane (the most expensive paint for the application) in its original Porsche Sky Blue, before fresh sound deadening material and weather stripping were applied throughout. </p><p>As many original parts have been maintained as possible. Most parts have been removed and refinished to proper factory specifications including knobs and switches, interior lights and trim were either polished, refinished or re-chromed. All gauges freshly rebuilt. The seating is recovered in high quality red leather with new carpets and headliner highlighting the fully restored steering wheel and re-chromed shifter.</p><p>The Captain's Car's undercarriage appears virtually new displaying all new seals and bushings, cables, kingpins, link pins, transmission mounts, voltage regulator, starter motor, Koni steering damper, master cylinder, brake hoses and lines, wheel bearings, discs, and freshly rebuilt calipers. The tires are Classic Vredesteins mounted on new chromed wheels capped with new hubcaps. The ceramic coated exhaust and heat exchangers were installed as was a new billet oil sump cover. The gas tank was dipped and refinished. The trunk is complete with a new spare tire, fresh battery, and toolkit and jack restored to a level befitting the car. The exterior sports new headlights, taillights and fresh emblems. All parts have either been cadmium plated, powder coated, sprayed or refinished to correct factory specifications. It has been gone through from top to bottom with an extreme level of care and attention to detail. The car shows “as new” and everything works exactly as it came from the factory including the cigarette lighter and all indicator and interior lights.</p><p>The engine has been meticulously rebuilt to 1,720 ccs with an upgraded camshaft increasing horsepower by 40 to an estimated 115 hp by Gaspare Fasulo of Gaswerks Garage. The transaxle is completely rebuilt with fresh synchros and bearings.</p><p>Included with the car are the original 1964 owner's manual, service book and several original keys. Also included are historical records including a bill of sale, registrations, repair receipts, inspections, and other materials tracing The Captain's relocations to bases while serving in the US Navy. Among these are a photocopy of the Captain's daughter at approximately three years old holding the door handle and personal notations. One describes the Fall of '66 when his pregnant wife Mary and friends Terry's pregnant wife drove the car cross country to be shipped to Hawaii as he and Terry rode the submarine Flasher from New London to Pearl Harbor.</p><p>This 356 is ready to go — for spirited driving, rallying or just blowing wind through your hair and is a must see.</p><p>Available by appointment only. </p><p> </p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$145,000               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

This example was a resident of California and owned by a 356 Registry member for many years. It was restored in 1994-1995 to Concours throughout and has accumulated light mileage since. The restoration included a bare-metal respray and all chrome, rubber and full interior were carried out by a well-known California based marque specialist, Jim Gordon. This 356B comes will all original invoicing and records of the complete restoration. In addition, the engine and transmission were fully rebuilt in 2012 – as were all suspension, steering and braking systems. The matching numbers engine has been uprated to 1750cc Big Bore specification for added power and includes all invoices. Engine rebuild/reseal was carried out with Nikasil cylinders, new fuel lines/filters electronics and more, as well as complete service of braking system, new wheel cylinders, master cylinder, suspension/sway bar bushings gaskets and more. Currently Dellorto (maintenance free) carburetors are mounted, having custom aluminum plates fitted to mount OEM filters. Included are the original Solex carbs/Black OEM standard filters. During its recent ownership Northern California ownership, it has been loved and maintained, but used for the occasional jaunt up or down Route 1. It starts instantly without the need of a choke and the power and response is nothing short of fantastic for a Porsche of this era.</p><p>A near perfect original Blaupunkt Frankfurt E-Series Radio (1961) was secured and rebuilt and is fully functional. Additionally, there is a tasteful stealth mounted Nakamichi head unit in the glove box with Infinity Premium speakers behind the early covers/grills.</p><p>This 356B runs and drives extremely well - it is tight, powerful and a pleasure to drive. All restoration and service records, the original tools, jack, spare tire, owner's manual, original keys with Reutter key pouches, as well as an original Reutter luggage rack and 2 sets of luggage straps accompany the car. Collector owned and serviced regardless of use, this example is ready for immediate and dependable enjoyment and is an excellent opportunity to acquire a restored 356B with desirable options for the 356 enthusiast.</p>             <p>             <b>Price: </b>$139,500 obo               <br>                          </p>",0,04-25-2018,,

Interior fittings were upgraded as well, with a new steering wheel lock and its instruments now mounted in rubber rings. Externally, new door handles a safer design replaced the earlier push-button type, and the cars were delivered with full factory undercoating for the first time. Stopping power was provided by 11.1-inch ventilated front and 11.4-inch ventilated rear disc brakes, which proved more than enough for a 2,400-pound car.
