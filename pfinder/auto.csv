But with a performance model like the Porsche 911 GT3, you can't get away with not pushing further alongside your competition. And as 2016 rolled over to 2017, the GT3 saw one of its biggest changes in years. The famous flat-six that powers the driver's 911 was bumped up to a nice, round, 4.0-liter displacement. That resulted in an even 500-horsepower output, matching the outgoing GT3 RS and trending the more affordable GT3 model even further up the ladder. New shocks, rubber, and rear-wheel steering are among the smaller changes that add up to the 991.2 GT3's all-around prowess on road and track. McLaren Philadelphia is pleased to offer you this GT3 with just 263 miles. Our team strives to make each experience here at McLaren Philadelphia the best possible, so here are a few key components of this vehicle. This GT3 is covered in Chalk exterior paint with Black interior. Porsche equipped this 911 with many options including: Carbon Fiber Interior Package, Seat Belts in Guards Red, BOSE Surround Sound System, Door-Sill Guards in Carbon Fiber, Fire Extinguisher, Front Axle Lift System, Full Bucket Seats, Instrument Dials in Guards Red, Luggage Net in Passenger Footwell, Side Skirts Painted, Smoking Package, SportDesign Exterior Mirrors in Carbon Fiber, Wheels Painted in Satin Black and much more for an MSRP of $169,470. As with all the rare and exotic sports cars sold here at McLaren Philadelphia, this vehicle has passed through our own strenuous 100-point inspection. Accompanying this vehicle is Spare Key, Owner's Manual, and Original Window Sticker.

But with a performance model like the Porsche 911 GT3, you can't get away with not pushing further alongside your competition. And as 2016 rolled over to 2017, the GT3 saw one of its biggest changes in years. The famous flat-six that powers the driver's 911 was bumped up to a nice, round, 4.0-liter displacement. That resulted in an even 500-horsepower output, matching the outgoing GT3 RS and trending the more affordable GT3 model even further up the ladder. New shocks, rubber, and rear-wheel steering are among the smaller changes that add up to the 991.2 GT3's all-around prowess on road and track. McLaren Philadelphia is pleased to offer you this GT3 with just 263 miles. Our team strives to make each experience here at McLaren Philadelphia the best possible, so here are a few key components of this vehicle.

The new 911 exemplifies this apparent contradiction. The tapering roofline has been lowered, exposing fewer surfaces to the air. The front track has been widened for improved cornering stability. Circling around to the side of the 911, one can see that the exterior mirrors are now mounted directly on the doors resulting in improved aerodynamics as well as a longer wheelbase, and shorter overhangs at both front and rear. The new engines follow the time honored 911 design: six horizontally opposed cylinders providing a lower center of gravity. Output has been increased to 350hp in the 911 Carrera , 400hp in the 911 Carrera S, 475hp in the 911 GT3, 520hp in the 911 Turbo, and 560hp in the 911 Turbo S. This power is transmitted by the introduction of a 7-speed manual gearbox or, optionally, the Porsche Doppelkupplung transmission, which offers gear changes with virtually no interruption in the flow of power. The refined steering wheel features a high-grip smooth-leather rim. Fitted as standard, the 911 has refined sport seats that combine comfort with racing-style support and now feature 4-way power >",0,2018-02-11,,4WD

The new 911 exemplifies this apparent contradiction. The tapering roofline has been lowered, exposing fewer surfaces to the air. The front track has been widened for improved cornering stability. Circling around to the side of the 911, one can see that the exterior mirrors are now mounted directly on the doors resulting in improved aerodynamics as well as a longer wheelbase, and shorter overhangs at both front and rear. The new engines follow the time honored 911 design: six horizontally opposed cylinders providing a lower center of gravity. Output has been increased to 350hp in the 911 Carrera , 400hp in the 911 Carrera S, 475hp in the 911 GT3, 520hp in the 911 Turbo, and 560hp in the 911 Turbo S. This power is transmitted by the introduction of a 7-speed manual gearbox or, optionally, the Porsche Doppelkupplung transmission, which offers gear changes with virtually no interruption in the flow of power. The refined steering wheel features a high-grip smooth-leather rim. F>",0,2018-02-11,,2WD

Clean CARFAX. GT Silver Metallic 2015 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet AWD 7-Speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) 3.8L 6-Cylinder BiTurbo 911 Turbo Cabriolet, GT Silver Metallic, Black w/All Leather Seat Trim, 14-Way Electric Sport Seats w/Memory Package, Navigation System. Awards: * JD Power Initial Quality Study (IQS) * 2015 KBB.com Brand Image Awards Reviews: * Masterful handling soulful engines indefatigable brakes daily-driver seat comfort and ride quality endless customization possibilities respectable fuel economy. Source: Edmunds * For over 50 years, no car has remained so instantly recognizable. The new 911 exemplifies this apparent contradiction. The tapering roofline has been lowered, exposing fewer surfaces to the air. The front track has been widened for improved cornering stability. Circling around to the side of the 911, one can see that the exterior mirrors are now mounted directly on the doors resulting in improved aerodynamics as well as a longer wheelbase, and shorter overhangs at both front and rear. The new engines follow the time honored 911 design: six horizontally opposed cylinders providing a lower center of gravity. Output has been increased to 350hp in the 911 Carrera , 400hp in the 911 Carrera S, 475hp in the 911 GT3, 520hp in the 911 Turbo, and 560hp in the 911 Turbo S. This power is transmitted by the introduction of a 7-speed manual gearbox or, optionally, the Porsche Doppelkupplung transmission, which offers gear changes with virtually no interruption in the flow of power. The refined steering wheel features a high-grip smooth-leather rim. Fitted as standard, the 911 has refined sport seats that combine comfort with racing-style support and now feature 4-way power adjustment. The traditional choice of interior options includes innovative additions. A new lighting design package allows you to customize the level of illumination in the footwells, ignition lock, storage compartments, rear compartment, and overhead console. Te>",0,2018-02-11,,4WD

It competes with other sports cars in the $60,000 range such as the BMW Z4 and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class convertible. While the Cayman may not have the absolute horsepower of some of its rivals, it can generally match them in performance thanks to a lightweight body, exceptional mid-engine chassis dynamics, and plenty of engineering know-how. Unlike many of its competitors, the Cayman is also an extremely refined vehicle and as such, it's easy to live with day-to-day. The Cayman's high level of quality and Porsche's signature precision are what really set the car apart.

The vehicle began its life as a standard 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 (993 Generation), but after many months of labor (& love) and over $90,000 invested into the build, the result is an incredibly unique and exciting driving machine that turns heads faster than many modern exotics. This project was recently completed in late 2015 and very little mileage was put on the car since; it is practically brand new in its current form. The transformation begins with a VAD (Vogue Auto Design) wide-body conversion kit, which completely transforms the shape and stance of the original car. It also has an adjustable (and riveted) wide-body skirt kit. The car is fitted with SSR Professor wheels ($6,500), Toyo Proxes R888 tires ($2,500) and new Big Red 993 Turbo ventilated brakes (orange calipers). In order to facilitate ride height adjustments and clearance, the vehicle has an AccuAir self-levelling coilover replacement suspension with an Airdynamiks control management system. The system is highly intuitive and works extremely well. Under the hood is a battle-tested and fully rebuilt 5.7L V8 Corvette LS1 engine ($6,500) which has been tuned and produces a healthy 475hp. The engine has less than 800 miles on it. The build includes a FAST 102mm intake, a FAST 102mm throttle body and more.The original Porsche 993 6-speed manual transmission is also used. The original vehicle was fully stripped,sanded down and professionally repainted in an original Porsche color called Continental Orange (color code 107). The paint job looks fantastic and and the color really accentuates the car s impressive stance and appearance. The car is completely wrapped with a transparent clear coat by SunTek WWW.KELLYMOTORCARS.COM WE FINANCE. WE TAKE TRADES. CALL RYAN 215-601-8611",0,2018-02-11,,

Porsche revealed the latest Spyder model in April 2015 at the New York Auto Show. The styling of the car is similar to the previous generation Spyder, continuing the twin hump rear deck and manually operated canvas top. It also shares some styling with the Cayman GT4, using the same front and rear fascia. The engine is also shared with the Cayman GT4, a 3.8L flat-6, making this the largest capacity and most powerful engine used in a Boxster with 385 bhp. It is also the lightest current Porsche, weighing 2,899 lb. This was achieved through the use of aluminum doors and rear lid, the manually operated roof and unique light weight 20 inch wheels. The air conditioning and audio system are also removed, although can be added as no cost options. Braking is via larger brakes than used on the Boxster S, being 340mm front and 330mm rear units taken from the 911 Carrera S. It also shares from the GT4 a limited slip differential combined with Porsche Torque Vectoring and features a 30mm lower ride height. Additionally it also borrows the steering rack from the 911 Turbo S along with the same reduced diameter GT steering wheel as used in both the GT3 and GT4. The only gearbox available is a 6 speed manual. The Spyder was only available as a 2016 model with a total worldwide production of 2400 units. This lovely example Boxster Spyder is fitted with the following options, 64L fuel tank, white exterior paint, wheel center caps with colored crest, door opening loops in color of decorative stitch, fire extinguisher, supplemental safety bars in exterior color, wind deflector, air conditioning, leather with alcantara in conjunction with stitching in contrasting yellow color, mobile phone integration, Porsche dynamic lights system (PDLS), light design package, stitching in contrasting color, reverse camera, steering wheel trim and gear lever in smooth finish leather in black, rear side air>",0,2018-02-11,,2WD

The new 911 exemplifies this apparent contradiction. The tapering roofline has been lowered, exposing fewer surfaces to the air. The front track has been widened for improved cornering stability. Circling around to the side of the 911, one can see that the exterior mirrors are now mounted directly on the doors resulting in improved aerodynamics as well as a longer wheelbase, and shorter overhangs at both front and rear. The new engines follow the time honored 911 design: six horizontally opposed cylinders providing a lower center of gravity. Output has been increased to 350hp in the 911 Carrera , 400hp in the 911 Carrera S, 475hp in the 911 GT3, 520hp in the 911 Turbo, and 560hp in the 911 Turbo S. This power is transmitted by the introduction of a 7-speed manual gearbox or, optionally, the Porsche Doppelkupplung transmission, which offers gear changes with virtually no interruption in the flow of power. The refined steering wheel features a high-grip smooth-leather rim. Fitted as standard, the 911 has refined sport seats that combine comfort>",0,2018-02-11,,

The new 911 exemplifies this apparent contradiction. The tapering roofline has been lowered, exposing fewer surfaces to the air. The front track has been widened for improved cornering stability. Circling around to the side of the 911, one can see that the exterior mirrors are now mounted directly on the doors resulting in improved aerodynamics as well as a longer wheelbase, and shorter overhangs at both front and rear. The new engines follow the time honored 911 design: six horizontally opposed cylinders providing a lower center of gravity. Output has been increased to 350hp in the 911 Carrera , 400hp in the 911 Carrera S, 475hp in the 911 GT3, 520hp in the 911 Turbo, and 560hp in the 911 Turbo S.

No engine sounds like this - the last of the Mezger-built race-oriented Porsche engines.  Slight upgrades include:  Evolution Motorsports tune (improves throttle response dramatically), Sharkwerks bypass, coolant-pipe fix (a MUST to fix the only Achilles Heel on this model), and a DSC suspension controller (stiffens each damper independently based on G's and speed - much more balanced than stock).   5 total days at HPDE events.  Only a handful of stage 1 & 2 over-revs (previous owner). Car has deviated red stitching and red Alcantara shifter (black one comes with car).  Perfect paint.  Zero dings. Slight patina in front of rear wheel wells below rock guards, as expected. Black floor mats come with car as well as red ones.  Car serviced meticulously and pampered with Total Oil, racing brake fluid, new brakes/rotors this year, new clutch, Nitto NT01 tires with 80% tread, 19&quot; chrome wheels, and no flaws.  Replaced the front spoiler about a year ago.  This car is the most pure, raw, visceral Porsche model - a true driver's car.  Brand new TPMS sensors plus a wheel alignment just performed on 1-7-2018.

This led to better efficiency and power throughout the lineup, but a very distinct new sound unlike the wail of a naturally-aspirated flat-six. But changes were few to the top-tier Turbo model, and it certainly made the transition to the 991.2 generation seamlessly. Its looks show minor refreshment, but the little things add up to a much more attractive overall package for the 911. Inside, Porsche's new infotainment system is added and a new steering wheel with selectable driving modes comes over from the 918 Spyder hypercar. The 3.8-liter engine gets a modest bump to 540 horsepower, and the all-wheel drive grip delivers 60 mph in just under 3 seconds. McLaren Philadelphia is pleased to offer you this 911 Turbo with 2,119 miles. Our team strives to make each experience here at McLaren Philadelphia the best possible, so here are a few key components of this vehicle. This 911 is covered in Agate Gray Metallic exterior paint with Black/Bordeaux Red interior. Porsche equipped this 911 with many options including: Heated Multifunction Steering Wheel, 18-Way Adaptive Sport Seats, Burmester High-End Surround Sound System, Electric Slide/Tilt Sunroof in Glass, Front Seat Heating, Front Seat Ventilation, Illuminated Door-Sill Guards in Stainless Steel, Lane Change Assist, Memory Package, Seat Belts in Bordeaux Red and much more for an MSRP of $174,340. As with all the rare and exotic sports cars sold here at McLaren Philadelphia, this vehicle has passed through our own strenuous 100-point inspection. Accompanying this vehicle is Owner's Manual, Spare Key, Car Cover, and Battery Tender. This vehicle is being sold with the Balance of Factory Warranty until 7/23/2020 or 50,000 miles whichever occurs first.

Oslo Blue resembles Voodoo Blue in most lighting situations, but it is slightly darker and more understated. In addition to this extremely rare paint the car was factory optioned with the very rarely seen DZL option package which includes deviated graphics, wheels, mirrors, GT3 RS logo and wing tips in Slate Grey as opposed to the two standard options found on the configurator, white gold or guards red. To make the vehicle even more unique it was configured without road car creature comforts with radio delete, AC delete, lightweight bucket seats and PCCB ceramic brakes. This special RS is a raw and one of a kind paint to sample color/graphic vehicle that simply cannot be replicated. It could not have been ordered more perfectly for the collector as Porsche's street legal track focused machine. At 1,550 miles the engine was replaced under the original 4-year/50,000 mile warranty by Porsche and has zero over-revs in all six ranges.

Original, numbers matching 505-code car as confirmed by Porsche Certificate of Authenticity.  It is a two-owner, California car ready to compliment any fine collection.     After a six-year hiatus because of new US emissions regulations and the development of a new electronic engine management system to control exhaust emissions, Porsche brought the 911 Turbo back to the U.S. market in 1986.  During that period, clients asked the factory to create a street-legal version of the brilliant 935 Group 5 car under its Special Wishes Program Sonderwunschprogramm.  The highly coveted edition featured a flat, aerodynamic nose with retractable headlights, widened and louvered front fenders, more muscular rear quarters with air intakes and stylish strakes, extended and boxed rocker panels, an additional oil cooler, and a large rear spoiler, which housed an intercooler atop the engine lid.  After 930s returned to the U.S. market in 1986, Porsche formalized the design the following year, with option number 505, also known as the 930S.  Equipped with a four-speed manual transmission and limited-slip differential, this stunning Guards Red 1988 930 has only 3,250 miles and represents a rarity even for this limited edition collectible model.  2 keys, books, and records included.  Quite possibly the finest example currently offered for sale.  Offers welcomed and trades considered.  Worldwide delivery available.  Please call or email for more information.",0,2018-02-11,,2WD

Pumping out over 600 Hp and a 0-60 in about 3.5 secs, this Super Porsche was not for the faint of heart. Luckily, Porsche fitted this model with huge Carbon Ceramic brakes for the ultimate stopping power. Less than 650 units were produced for the U.S market. This particular example in GT Silver over Black has less than 8,600 miles and will come with the important Luggage set that was sold with the car when new. The clutch is still at 29.8 mm life left (out of 31 mm) and the car's complete body is wrapped in Paint Protection Film clear bra.An amazing car at a great price for Porsche collectors or connoisseurs!",0,2018-02-11,,2WD
