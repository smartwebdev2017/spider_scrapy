Very clean car, no paintwork, no issues, one owner up until the time I purchased from that in April (carfax may still say one owner, not sure).  I have all service records from the day it was born.  6-speed, Sport Chrono, PDLS, Bose, sunroof. It is a $94k build.  Easily a 9/10 in and out, carefully driven by the prior owner (an enthusiast who is very meticulous about his cars) and myself. He ""upgraded"" to a TTS....Personally, I have never taken the car above 3,000 RPM until I see the oil temp reading 185.  One tiny scratch on the rear decklid, and a few rock chips on the front bumper and low hood (the car doesn't have a clear bra, which is really the ONLY thing I can negatively say about it, condition wise, aside from a bit of wear on the driver's side bolster, and 2 very light scuffs on the e-brake handle.  It has been babied, to say the least. Just driven the ""right amount"". In the interest of disclosure, he did say he attended one HDPE; the inspection was great, no overrev issues. You won't be disappointed. I have not titled it; threw on the ""Porsche Rancho Mirage"" when I drove it home after purchasing it after business hours and could't yet get a temp tag. 

The previous owner said he waxed it every 3 months with Zymol, and I believe him. The clear coat is pristine: it looks to never have seen an automated carwash.  My neighbors, who don't know Porsche, thought it was maybe a year or 2 old, people were blown away when they found out it was going on a decade now.  

Mods by previous owner:
integrated radar/laser detector
Gundo Hack
Ceramic tint on windows

Mods by me: Bilstein B8 struts and H&amp;R springs (supposedly the ""X73"" option for this car that was not offered in the states; we got PASM instead).  Stock struts included with sale.  It really tightens up this car!  

Reason for selling: a month after purchase, I fell into a good deal on a C2S 6MT. They are different cars, but equally enjoyable.  I am sticking with the C2S because it has full natural leather; I really fell in love with it. Performance wise, the cars are very similar on back roads; touch more power with the C2S and less weight, a bit more playful, the C4 is a bit more planted and pulls you through the turn more, feel like it can be pushed a bit harder, it also looks subjectively better with the ""wide hips"".  With that said, if the C2S hadn't fallen into my lap, I would be very happy enjoying this car for the next however many years.  I have enjoyed each and every mile on it.  Either car has plenty of power, even at 4200 feet. 

I am planning on giving this to the local dealer to have them consign it, but I figured I would throw it up here first.  Please, no offers.  Asking price is firm; just looking to get out of it what I am into it for.  I will likely have that price after the consignment cut anyways, and no headaches for me, but if someone really wants her, feel free to give me a shout. I can add interior pics when I have better light.

Leaks about a quarter size drop after a week, but I think it's because I went to Mobil 1 0w-40 euro spec oil.  It didn't leak previously when it had the Castrol 15w-50.

Front engine, rear transmission, perfect 50/50 weight distribution. Manual steering, disc brakes all around, and German reliability. If you are looking for a show car, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a driver's car, stick around!

We bought this car a year ago and took it straight from a dealer's lot to Gerber Motorsports in Seattle and had a complete service performed on the vehicle: all new oil, brake fluid, coolant, new timing belt and bearings (receipts available for all work). This car has been a great driver ever since. How great, you ask? Well, it has been to the top of Hurricane Ridge in February (to the shock of all Subaru drivers with chains on their wheels). This car has been successfully autocrossed three times with the Porsche Club of America this summer, and is simply a fantastic driving car. Also capable of carrying a Costco trip of groceries in the hatchback. Perfect.

What doesn't work:
Odometer
Clock
AC (though the fan still blows, I suspect simply recharging the system will fix it)
Paint is faded. Front impact bumper is crooked (easy fix with a new strut).
Passenger site window doesn't scroll down

What does work:
Everything the driver needs to go
Lights
Gas
Brakes
Clutch
Sunroof (it's manual)
Tires: Brand new rubber put all around in March
Just changed oil (August 23rd) by Gerber Motorsports, they checked the car and said it is good to go!
New DME Relay (August)

Bonus features:
The original owner optioned this car with Fuchs wheels, rare raised steering wheel, and the optional performance suspension package! Did I mention this car is a driver's car?
We also have a $250 wind- and rainproof cover that comes with the car.

Words of caution:
The only mechanical problem we've had is overheating on hot days in traffic jams. Other than that, she's been a reliable daily driver and fun car.

$4999 sound like a lot of money for a car with faded paint? A set of genuine 15"" Fuchs wheels on Ebay covers most of that. I like to think of the wheels as insurance for this car  

Please reply or PM if you are interested. We have receipts for all work performed since we acquired the vehicle.

Cheers,

The car was delivered new to a Stanley Wyner of Pittsburgh, PA, and the original maintenance booklet is stamped with the first few services. While intermediate service history is lacking, the current owner had the car mechanically refurbished in 2016 at Porsche specialist Steinel's Autowerks to the tune of almost $11k. The full receipt detailing the work performed is in the documents section on our website.
The car runs and drives beautifully. It is believed to be original mileage, and comes with an actual mileage title. The motor and gearbox are original to the car and a Certificate of Authenticity is on order. The previous owner had an aftermarket radio which was removed (the door speakers are still present) and a blockoff panel installed in its place. 1972 was of course the only year for the passenger side external oil fill, and as such, this is a fairly rare car should somebody choose to restore it to the original Signal Yellow. The car is completely rust free, and is a very presentable driver. The car comes with a spare 14inch Fuchs, jack, and original tool roll.

For sale is my 2016 Cayman GT4.  Car has 1500 gentle road miles and just had an oil change done at a local dealership at around 1100 miles.  Car has never been tracked.  Kept in a garage and has never seen rain. 

I am the original owner and car was delivered in June of 2016 making this a late production GT4. 

Car was delivered with Michelin Cup 2 tires. 

Car was flat-bedded from the dealership to my detailer where it was paint corrected and XPEL wrapped.  It has a full front covered, side mirrors, rockers, roof, and rear wing are all covered in XPEL PPF.   Side windows and rear hatch window were tinted as well.  Please see pictures of the work being done.  Car has white side markers now which will be included as well as all weather porsche OEM floor mats. 

Car is in immaculate condition overall.  Always hand washed personally and babied.  

I will be posting more picture but please let me know if you're interested. Window sticker included.  Includes Lightweight buckets

This is the last generation with the original design for the motor, body and suspension and the last generation to be designated 911.  It is an icon in automotive history.   The interior and exterior are original and are in very good condition but both show some of the wear and tear that comes with 112k miles and 30 years of age.  The exterior is Diamond Blue Metallic and the interior is burgundy.  There are no cracks in the dash covering.  I am the sixth owner.  The car was purchased in 2008 and I have put 31k miles on the car.  There have been no accidents in my ownership but the shading of the paint on the driver's door and the rear quarter show there have been two mishaps under its previous owners.  The car tracks true.  The same set of tires have been on the car for 31k miles and the tread wear is even.  The AC was not working when I purchased the car and does not work now.  All the AC parts are there, but there is a leak.   It worked for a few days the last time it was recharged but I never went to the expense to track down the leak.  The radio is aftermarket and was in the car when purchased.  The wheels are the original 6 and 7 inch forged Fuchs.  The rear tires are ready to be replaced.  The engine was rebuilt to replace the rings.  The rebuild was performed at a dealership under a previous owner.  I have that owners name.   I have replaced a vertex muffler and chip with an M&amp;K exhaust and a Steve Wong chip.  It also has a Fabspeed sport cat and will pass the Tennessee emissions test with no modifications.  Other parts that have been replaced are:  Air flow meter, rear calipers and rotors, parking brake shoes, CV boots, steering wheel bushing, wiper switch, urn signal switch, tignition switch, targa headliner, engine compartment sound mat, foot well blower fan, hood and rear deck struts and driver's side window switch.  The car is garaged year round.  Included is the original spare tire, tool kit and air compressor.  This car is an investment and its value will continue to rise for you as it has for me.

'92 968 cab in Horizon Blue with dark blue top. Its in what I would call *very* good condition. The front belts and the timing chain and pads have been serviced by the previous owner before I bought it 2 years ago. The car really needs nothing to be driven anywhere in the US. It is completely stock and everything works as it should.

It has a tiptronic transmission. The car still has plenty of sporting characteristics configured this way and you can manually shift if you feel so inclined when engaging in sprited driving situations, but its perfect for cruising on the highway, or in traffic, and its a huge plus if you get caught in stop and go driving. Its most at home if you want to drop the top and go on a nice cruise with your SO. The 968 cab was never intended to be a race car. A lot of the detractors of ""tiptronic transmission"" have never actually driven a car equipped with one.

Exterior: The car has had paint repair work done to it due to two different parking lot incidents, but has never been wrecked. It shows *very well* up close or at a distance, this car is a real looker. It has a couple of minor rock chips in the front, a cracked fog lamp (again, from a rock and I have a new replacement one that goes with the car), the top is original and the rear window shows age but thats all the flaws you will find.

Interior: Its the classic two tone grey and is in good condition. No cracks on the dash, no tears in the seats and no major stains or discoloration in the carpet. The only non factory original piece in the interior is the Porsche CDR-220 that replaced the original am/fm/cassette player that died a few years ago. The antenna is not hooked up as I was planning on putting in a Bluetooth stereo.

Mechanically: This car is very solid. As mentioned before, the front belts have been serviced and should be good to go for the next 45k miles or so, the timing chain and pads are fresh and should be good for the next 80k miles or so. every effort has been made to keep the car completely stock and on the factory recommended maintenance schedule, and aside from Koni's in the rear and 968 M030 caster mounts that replaced the originals, its has only used factory or oem replacement parts when being serviced. It even still has a lot of the original kosmoline spray on the underside of the car that the factory shot the undercarriage with prior to shipping it overseas.

This car is one of 34 sent to the US in Horizon Blue, and its not likely that you will encounter another on the road. Truthfully, I am on the fence about selling it but the car because it looks so good and I have a lot of pride of ownership when I drive it around. I just don't drive it enough.

Extras:
I have an additional cat back exhaust from a 20k mile 968 (nothing wrong with the one that's on currently), a new fog lamp lens, front grill assembly, a set of factory front shocks that are new in the box, and an air filter kit.

The car is located in SE South Dakota.

The chassis has ~200k on it, and the engine has ~100k (came out of an automatic with 80k at the time). Technically the car is still street legal, and would simply need the stock steering wheel put back on in place of the Sparco that is on there now. It will pass a safety inspection (stock seatbelts still installed) as well as emissions (still has catalytic converter). Since owning, I have kept it in a garage and only driven it on the street to/from some local tracks, tech inspection, and for the occasional Sunday drive. This is a great car for learning how to drive on the track without any electronic nannies, and it has been extremely reliable. The timing belt/water pump service was just performed in May 2017. $6500


The color is called Crystal Green Metallic. The paint is consistent with a car that is 31 years old. 

While this car is perfect for DEs as it is, if you wanted to race this car competitively in SCCA, NASA, PCA, etc. it could still go on a diet (heater core, glass, bumpers, headlight motors could all be removed), and some further suspension work (camber plates, corner balancing, couple more spherical bushings in the front) would finish it off.

The car was then professionally built from the tub up using Porsche purist components. Turbo control arms, Carrera brakes, adjustable front and rear sway bars, (through tub in front)
the 1980's 3.2 liter was completely rebuilt before installation. Euro spec., (+-275 bhp.) has ony 6 track HPDE days on it (no races), &amp; has 180 lbs df compression across the board. Fuel Safe fuel cell, Stand alone harness and switching, New Red line oils, and just added new Turbo output shafts. the exhaust sounds awesome !!! car pulls strong. shifter has spring loaded gate. race seats with 5 point harnesses
Recent ""Gulf"" scheme is a single stage very nice race car job, with only minor chips, etc. this is a race car quality paint job. do not expect a mint concourse paint. it does have a few chips.
Runs and drives very well, with excellent balance and tire contact. Fenders rolled to accommodate Turbo size Fuchs replicas. 16 x 8, and 16 x 9. w/bump steer kit. Currently has Hoosier 245/275 Race tires.
Composite front and rear RSR style Facias, and ""Longest"" rear deck lid from AIR who makes them.
Hackels go up when you hear an open header 911 run on the street, and even with ""fake"" headlights, one might be tempted to drive it in its current config. This car was built as a track car, &amp; until now, has been trailered to all its events.
it does come with a title so it can be registered to drive on the street. however, it will need to have headlights installed. currently has stickers that look like headlights. i think i may even have a set to throw in the deal.

I am posting it on rennlist only for now with the hopes another enthusiast will be able to enjoy it
I am not looking to make any money, the car has a sticker of $154,810
It is totally stock with clear bra on front 1/3 of the car


As we know on this forum the 2016 has G motor And according to the dubious Macca there has not been any issues with these engines because of the upgraded oiling system on these cars. Also worth noting Porsche did not build many 2016's because of production of the RS 

The transaction will go thru my local Porsche dealer, and the car can be cpo'ed at the Purchasers expense if so desired. As we now now PAG has warranteed the engines for 10 years or 120k 
This car has an inservice date as of 12/14/15

The  last service was this past June oil change and recall on coolant reservoir was replaced 

The car has not had any paint or body work and is in pristine condition 

Thanks for looking

The car has been driven by me for two track seasons, a total of about 20 days.  The guy I bought it from autocrossed it. The car is in excellent condition and has been well maintained by me, with Amsoil oil changes and Motul changes between events.  The front bumper cover has been repainted due to stone chips, but there has been no other body damage while I have had the car.  The prior owner also had the front bumper cover repainted himself due to a garage parking scratch.  Only major flaw in paint is one approximately 1.5-inch scratch in driver's door, currently covered by the Welsh dragon sticker.  Windshield has one rock chip, which I will have filled, and which is on the passenger's side.

The car is very fast and incredibly responsive.  You can see it on the track here:

it's a 2004 in speed yellow. i am the third owner. currently has 86k miles on it. i do drive it so those miles will slowly creep up.
overall the car is in great condition. it has never been crashed, had any paint work or body work. the clear coat is peeling on the mirrors but otherwise the original paint is in good shape aside from normal little chips and such as you would expect from any 86k mile car.
the interior is also in good shape. minimal wear. most of the wear is on the driver floor mat which can easily be replaced.
this car is 100% virgin stock except for that i installed a cup front spoiler and a pioneer head unit (for bluetooth) and a small amp stashed inside the dash. also replaced the trashed factory speakers. it went from being unusable to actually sounding pretty nice. i do have the original radio and is included with the car. i also had the windows tinted. i bought, from another rennlister, a set of cat byass/mufflers to install on it to give it more sound but never got around to it. the wheels had some scuffs on them so i plasti-dipped them black. i planned on having them powder coated black but wanted to try it out first. and i like the way they look. it can always be peeled off and turned back to silver.
the car was owned by a doctor in new orleans who drove it to work every day. he sold it to the second owner who hardly ever drove it and i bought it from him. to my knowledge it has never been on the track. i planned on maybe taking it one day but i already have a dedicated track car so i just never did.
since i've had it i did an oil change and put new spark plugs. my next project was going to flush the brake fluid. i was also planning on putting new tires on it since the rears are starting to get low.
i don't think the coolant lines have been welded or pinned as this car never saw the track. 8k miles ago the car got 2 new rear struts, a new front main seal and upgraded lsd from brian harris porsche in new orleans. more recently at 83k miles it got a new fuel pump from orbit racing. and as mentioned, at 84800 it got new plugs and oil change with liqui-moly. 
i have the coa, window sticker, both keys, books and manuals
all that being said, i am getting a 7-3 and am a little reluctant as to which i'll like better. i want to have both with me to drive them both and then decide which i'll keep. the 6 has the rawness that i love. i'll see how the 7 is. but most likely the 6 will get sold. so i want to gauge interest on my car. i think the price is fair considering there is not a single clean title, no accident, no story 6-3 out there with a price starting with a 5. it will be a few weeks before i'll be ready to actually let go of the car but i wanted to see what kind of response i get. 
i live in miami and work in hollywood. inspections are welcomed and encouraged. 
feel free to call me with any questions 786-412-1172
the car is a little dirty in the pics, i know. it's been raining every single day here in south florida so i haven't had a chance to wash it

I WILL LOOK AT ALL FAIR OFFERS.  I bought the car to enjoy in my retirement, but it seems my heart has other plans. The car has 129600. miles on it. The car has a clean Carfax, is a great driver, has a really nice interior, no modifications except a radio, and I have the original radio. This car shifts great, runs great, everything works, all gauges, even the outside temp gauge works. It is 1 of 20 in Slate gray with light gray interior.
The car does have some minor cosmetic needs. A tire came off a flatbed and hit the front of the car at low speed. It put a small crease in the hood and scratched up the right headlight cover, The bumper cover was also hit, but all the parts are easily repaired. I have an estimate form our local shop,(who has done several Sema factory five cars) of 1800.00 to completely fix the front and repaint from the doors forward. I do show the issues in the pictures. The rest of the car is shiny, but has some scuffs and chips from driving.

I will try to be as thorough as possible, and am more than happy to answer any questions. More pictures can also be provided. 
The car is a 2000 911 with ~197k on the clock. Non factory aero kit and complete repaint. It was involved in an accident on track last year. I ran up and over a bit or curbing that was much higher than anticipated at 40 MPH or so. This kicked the rear end of the car up, and upon bottoming out it put a hole in the oil pan and cracked the bottom of the engine block. I believe this also bent the driver side rent strut, and broke the driver side wheel(cheap cast wheels). There was very minimal body damage to the front splitter with a crack on the driver side lip, and the nozzle cover portion of the headlight also went missing. The gap on the hood from the bumper is slightly uneven as well though it was not completely perfect prior to this incident. Slight rub marks over passenger rear wheel arc can be buffed out. I took care of a portion just to make sure and can get this done if anyone is skeptical

I had intended to swap a ls3 into the car, but time for this has dried up so I am looking to pass the project on. I would be willing to sell either with or without the bulk of the track parts. I can remove the seats/harnesses/cage in about 30 minutes and replace with all stock items. 

I am asking 10k as is or 8k without the interior track modifications and GT3 front control arms. 

Track parts I put on the car:
GT3 front control lower arms
Tarret rear upper control arms
Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires
Pagid track pads
4 point bolt in cage
-Still have all stock interior pieces. Rear ""seats"" were taken out to accommodate the bolt in cage. Both front and rear are in good condition with no large rips/tears etc. 


Here's a list of what was done shortly before I purchased the car in spring 2016.

Wind shield and seal*

Front wheel bearings*

Front brake pads*

Front A arms*

Front drop links*

I am more than happy to assist with a buyer paid PPI at my local dealer. I have owned 18 Porsches over the past 15 years. I have a mechanic I trust at my local dealer. It will pass with flying colors. The only flaw I can report. I think the p/o had carbon GT2 bucket seats in the car and swapped them out with a set of seats that were not original to the car (They have red stitching where the full leather interior is silver stitching. The seats that were swapped are in excellent condition and do have alcantara inserts. The drivers seat has a burn hole in the cushion. The steering wheel shows the normal alcantara steering wheel wear.  Otherwise the interior looks incredible. This is a clean GT3. I plan on posting a walk around video this week.

I am testing the waters as I may sell it to upgrade to a 997 GT3 but not 100% sure I want to let her go just yet. I will consider trade offers (with cash on my end of course if needed for one if anyone is interested, although rare I am sure). 

 I purchased the car from a fellow Rennlister in October 2015 from Chicago. The car is amazing and was 100% stock when I purchased her so all the work below was done under my ownership and is of the highest quality. I wanted this car for three reasons, OEM LSD, OEM turbo brakes and RWD. The car has been nothing short of amazing in my ownership.

 Full disclosure, the cars engine was rebuilt by a Porsche dealership in Chicago prior to me owning it (Loeber Porsche) and I have the receipts for the work done. Car has about 20k miles on it since the rebuild, burns or leaks zero oil and runs fantastic. Pulls hard and strong like it should. All OEM parts were used as it was done under warranty. Also, the car had an incident where an old lady rolled back and bumped the front bumper. There was almost zero damage done to the car minus a scuff or two nor her car as well but the lady wanted to go through insurance hence why the car fax shows an accident on file. I removed the stock front bumper and had the car fully examined here in Buffalo and there was zero damage done. Since then I have replaced the bumper with an OEM euro turbo front bumper with all new gaskets and parts.

 The car is mechanically perfect. Zero problems under my ownership and she pulls hard and runs great. Just drove it to a car show in Ocean City 1,000+ miles without a single hiccup. I have all of the stock parts as well and if the new owner would like them they will be included in the sale if purchased for my asking price. All maintenance is up to date and documented, an oil change was just done (I do an oil change once a season or every 5,000 miles whichever comes first using Brad Penn oil and OEM filters). The car is stored in my heated garage on the OEM battery tender and is in fantastic shape. A two step paint correction was just done and the car doesn't see rain let alone snow so there is no rust to be found here.

 A lot of parts have been replaced on this car under my ownership that I do not list below(hood and trunk struts, various buttons, various trim pieces, battery, etc.). It would just take way to long to list but everything that has been replaced was replaced using OEM parts and only done so to improve the car itself.

 Some one will be getting an amazing car here that I hope they enjoy as much as I have. Any questions please do not hesitate to ask, I try to be as upfront and honest as I can be but I am sure I'm forgetting some little things. Thank you for your time, cheers.

My 1986 930. 

My friend is listing this car for me at his dealership on consignment. 

I am not a dealer; this is my personal car.

https://www.reserveautogroup.com/veh...tx-id-19842871







I have owned the car for four years. I am the second owner and it was 100% stock when I purchased it.

The car is highly modified with a built 3.5L from TurboKraft. On E85 it makes over 630whp on low boost and over 700whp on high boost. Case is original. Rotating assembly is 996/997.1 GT3 crank with Pauter Rods and CP Pistons 8.0:1 compression. LN Engineering Billet Cylinders. Cams were made by Edleweiss in Germany for the car. Heads were ported/polished and twin-plugged. Management is run via AEM Infinity with flex fuel support. Ignition is twin plug via 2x M&amp;W CDI's and Honda COP's. 

Cooling is managed via two new carrera coolers in the front fenders as well as Elephant Racing's brass finned oil lines.

Gearbox is a built G50/01 with a CMS billet side case, polished gears, new bearings, Guard ATB and weldon external pump with its own heat exchanger in the rear fender.

Suspension is a full 935 front conversion with Bilstein RSR coilovers and digresive valving from Rebel S Racing. Rear setup is also Bilstein RSR with digresive valving. Banana arms have monoball bearings. Swaybars are Tarret bladed/adjustable. All suspension was supplied by Clint at Rebel S Racing.

Brakes are brand new OEM rotors with cool carbon pads. I have a brand new set of Carbotech XP10 pads to go with the car as a backup set with more initial bite.

Wheels are CCW Classic, size 17x9.0 et 30 and 17x11.5 et0. Finish is gloss black lips and hyper black centers. Tires are 255/40/17 and 315/35/17; Nitto NT05. Tires are in excellent shape. The left rear tire has a slow leak. It could have picked up a nail as our neighborhood suffered a hail storm and we have many nails on the roads lately. I can diagnose and repair as necessary. I do feel a set of NT-01's would be more appropriate for the car's power level.

Interior is RSR style conversion with AppBiz panels and carpet. All panels were originally tan but recovered by Bob Budd of Classic 9 Leathershop in black leather with french seams. Bolt in bar painted to match the car. Seats are Recaro ProFi XL's with Takata Europe (Schroth) 6-pt harnesses. I still have the original tan door panels and rear seats. Steering wheel is authentic Porsche 993GT2 wheel. Shifter is a Wevo unit in black for the G50/01 gearbox. Seats are secured using Recaro sliders. The driver's side slider is stiff and difficult to move.

Paint is original. The front bumper blade and valance are new. I have the originals. I replaced due to patina on originals and Kremer style valance on the car. Rear blade is original. I had the bumperette pads shaved and the holes filled with 2002 style license plate lights mounted. One could re-drill the holes and install the rear bumperettes. I still have them. Car has never been in an accident. 

I have the COA from PCNA as well as the original window sticker with the car.

I have truly loved this car but it is time for me to move on. I have three small children which consume the most of my free time. As I am racing in PCA, my car related focus is on racing and not driving my other cars. As such, I am downsizing my fleet of cars.

I know the car through and through. The motor/trans build was completed over a 2 year process by Chris Carroll of TurboKraft. He can tell you all about this car if you have any questions. The car has less than 500 miles on it since coming back from the build at TurboKraft. The build was completed December 2016. I have driven it enough to change the oil at this point.

I will personally deliver the car to you in my race trailer along with all the spare parts. I will be happy to go through the car with you 100% so that you are comfortable with me and the purchase.

This car has significant meaning to me and my desire is for it to go to a good home.

I have sold a few very special cars to others whom I have become friends with. I am happy to provide contact information of previous buyers to solicit a referral of my character and how I represent my car and myself.

Please do not hesitate to contact me directly to discuss the car as I want it to go to a good home.

Kind regards,

Chris.

History
Low-option, low-mile 2006 Carrera 2S Coupe, Speed Yellow on Black interior.  $86k MSRP with power seats, 19"" Carrera Classic wheels, and Sport Chrono Plus being the only options.

The car started off in FL before its first owner moved to the Philly area.  Always dealer maintained by the 1st owner.  I'm the second owner, and purchased it from a local 911 specialist in 2015.  The car had 9,2xx miles on it when I purchased it.  I've maintained it myself since buying it, but that really hasn't been anything other than oil changes, a brake fluid flush, and tires (replaced due to age).  Alway garaged and on a battery-tender, not driven in the winter or inclement weather.  I always drove it long enough to bring the oil up to temp.

Mods
Only two small tweaks: lowered on Eibach springs (with full alignment after the install) and 'gundo-hack' exhaust mod.  The exhaust mod basically mimics the PSE option at a fraction of the cost.  The car sounds great, and very OEM-like.

Also worth noting that I just spend $1700 on a full paint correction and CQuartz Ceramic coating.  This was done just this month, and was performed by the premier detailer in the area.

Condition
This is as close to a new 2006 as you can buy.  That being said, there are a few nicks and blemishes, as seen in the pics below...most would have to be pointed out to you to notice.  Interior and Exterior are both a solid 9/10.

Everything functions as it should, no CEL, no other warning lights.  Plenty of life left on the brakes and tires.  No smoking, no pets, no kids.  No track time, no auto-x. 

Please do your own homework, but the IMS issue that plagued the M96 and early M97 engines is no longer a concern for the 2006 model year.  I'm sure I'll still get that question over and over, but at least I tried to cover it in the ad writeup!

Why am I selling?
I rarely drive it.  I carpool with two others to work, and a 911 doesn't work that well with a toddler.  On top of that, any free time and money I have left over after work/school/household stuff goes towards my SpecBoxster.  I'll own another 911 in the future, but having this car sit in the garage doesn't make sense for me right now.  

Logistics
I'm right in between Baltimore and Philadelphia, 10 minutes off I95.  I've helped with shipping before, and I've met people at the airport before.  I've also boarded planes to go buy cars, so I'm familiar with it from both ends.  Willing to help out to get the deal done.  

Clean MD title, clean CarFax

Asking $50k for one of the cleanest 997.1's on the market.  I believe the pricing is in line with the asks on other clean, low-mileage examples.

Greetings Fellow Rennlisters,

Life circumstances have dictated that I sell my beloved RY 991.1  . This last of the 911 NA, 7MT Carrera comes mostly stock except for a few additions. Car comes complete with manuals and two sets of keys. Last service was done in 10/2016 (see attachment). This vehicle is financed. I will work with the buyer to ensure a smooth sale.

Noteables/Highlights:

-7MT
-Sport Chrono
-Aerokit Cup
-Interior trim in RY
-Key coverings in RY (NOT Porsche OEM. From Ebay)
-REAR WIPER!!! 
-Vinyl wrapped matte black roof and wing (Car was purchased with this installed. Gives the car a really unique look. Most people hardly guess that this car is a ""base"" Carrera)
-Tinted tail lights and side markers
-clear bra (This clear bra was either a DIY from a pre-cut kit or done by a shop by someone with unsteady hands. Close inspection will show that film was not applied as close to the edges, lifting near one of the radiation vents, misaligned around the hood Porsche crest, and shows signs of yellowing but VERY difficult to tell especially since the car is yellow. You really have to inspect closely to see these flaws, otherwise it's unnoticeable to the casual eye)

This is a third car that has always been garaged and never seen salt / snow. I'll post an overrev report as soon as I get a current one. At last check there were only a few range 1 and 2's. Nothing above that. 
The interior of the car is near perfect. The main wear area is the center console where your arms rests. 
The exterior of the car has the entire front third covered in Xpel paint film which still looks great. There are a few edges with some very minor dirt under the edge. You really have to look for it. The headlights, door handles, and mirrors are also covered. The clear stone guards on the rear corners have been replaced with OEM since they were yellowing. 
The rear tires (OEM Porsche) will need replacing soon. The fronts will probably last through another set of rears. 

Oil has been changed every 5k miles with Motul synthetic oil. I have a blackstone oil report showing better than average wear and no concerns that was done summer 2016. 

The car drives as new with no issues, noises, leaks, etc.. I had the clutch replaced at 40k miles by my local Porsche Dealer. They did the full clutch, pressure plate, throw-out bearing, and also rear main seal. 
Currently running Hawk Performance pads to cut down on brake dust.

Contact: PM or 434 981 6714 

I bought the car for weekend and track use but I'm rarely driving it and can't seem to find time for the track these days.   I've put less than 250 miles on it.  current mileage is right at 13k or just under.  The previous owner was extremely careful with the maintenance etc.... but did track the car heavily (est 9k track miles).  Engine oil and transmission oil changed every 4 track days, brake fluid/clutch circuit fluid replaced 2x per year etc...  All fluid including diff and trans are fresh at this time.  SRF brake/clutch fluid.

This is an extremely nice/clean GT3.  It's also a no BS base model with carbon seats or in other words optioned perfectly 

Will post up PICs asap. 

Front bumper, hood, front fenders, A-pillars, roof front, rockers are covered with 3M film, applied when the car had 25 miles. 
The windshield is covered with plastic tear off film to prevent windshield rash.

Engine has strange over rev history.  It's the situation where it has 1 count in the upper range which is impossible.  It does have a few range 1s.  Because of this strange history I had a leak down and compression test done and it was very good (As I recall 2 percent leak down).  I still have the leak down paper work which I can supply to the buyer.   

Again the previous owner tracked the car BUT was an extremely careful/knowledgable owner.  The 1st year the car was driven in the beginner group.  The owner had not been on track in years and was getting his feet wet again.  After the initial year or so he moved up to solo/intermediate.   

Some really nice track mods have been made: 
GMG RSR roll bar 
Shroth harnesses (new April 2016)
Guard 40/60 LSD internals installed 
996 shift cables, 997 front lower control arm monoballs
Numeric Racing shifter assembly
Semisolid engine mounts and Torque Solutions 75A durometer transmission mount 
5-bolt OEM wheel hubs with Apex studs/nuts and new wheel bearings installed @5,699 miles 
Brembo two piece rotors with PFC 08 pads front and rear (good condition)
Fikse 9x19 and 9x12 Profil 10 3-piece wheels (excellent condition)
Michelin Cup 2 245.35.19 and 315.30.19 tires, 1000 miles 
Disabled TPM system
Engine coolant fittings pinned
Sharkwerks stainless coolant pipes in place of OEM plastic pipes on engine oil cooler
Replaced all engine coolant hoses and water pump @ 4,505 mi, then replaced all engine and transmission coolant hoses @ 10,766 mi
Tarret and Rennline heim joint sway bar drop links
Elephant Engineering rear toe links and lock plates
Brey-Krause anti-sub strap mounts passenger and drivers seats

Add 10k and I'll include tons of extras:

PCCB rotors
extra pads, rotors, etc....etc... 
All these parts are well worth the additional cost.

The car does have some minor cosmetic needs. A tire came off a flatbed and hit the front of the car at low speed. It put a small crease in the hood and scratched up the right headlight cover, The bumper cover was also hit, but all the parts are easily repaired. I have an estimate form our local shop,(who has done several Sema factory five cars) of 1800.00 to completely fix the front and repaint from the doors forward. I do show the issues in the pictures.

I'm  generally very picky, but the car is what it is, and I like it for what  it is. My plan was for it to be a driving restoration/project with a  total respray at the very end.

Interior is cork, and very presentable as is. It has its share of heat  exposure (dash shrinkage, faded carpet) but the fronts were recovered  apparently very recently (no receipts, but they look fresh). The rears  look original (not as supple, but surprisingly still good, no rips), and  do not look out of place compared to the fronts.

The passenger window does not go down. All other functions seem to work, but the speedometer/odometer stopped working recently.

I am firm on my price. This does not need to be a quick sale. I am located in Utah can help arrange shipping. 

I will get updated pics in the next few days when I get her cleaned up.

My wife has grown tired of it and now it sits a lot. We have decided to move on from an Air Cooled 911 and are looking for some other fun car, maybe another Porsche or something else. Recently spent $5800 in service/repairs.

My 964 has been on display at the PCA Zone 8 Riverside Region Timeline event every year since I have owned the car in 2006 except when Rennsport Reunion was the same weekend.

It was the only 964 invited to be on display at the Porsche 991 launch event in Palm Springs CA Feb 2012.

History
Low-option, low-mile 2006 Carrera 2S Coupe, Speed Yellow on Black interior.  $86k MSRP with power seats, 19"" Carrera Classic wheels, and Sport Chrono Plus being the only options.

The car started off in FL before its first owner moved to the Philly area.  Always dealer maintained by the 1st owner.  I'm the second owner, and purchased it from a local 911 specialist in 2015.  The car had 9,2xx miles on it when I purchased it.  I've maintained it myself since buying it, but that really hasn't been anything other than oil changes, a brake fluid flush, and tires (replaced due to age).  Alway garaged and on a battery-tender, not driven in the winter or inclement weather.  I always drove it long enough to bring the oil up to temp.

Mods
Only two small tweaks: lowered on Eibach springs (with full alignment after the install) and 'gundo-hack' exhaust mod.  The exhaust mod basically mimics the PSE option at a fraction of the cost.  The car sounds great, and very OEM-like.

Also worth noting that I just spend $1700 on a full paint correction and CQuartz Ceramic coating.  This was done just this month, and was performed by the premier detailer in the area.

Condition
This is as close to a new 2006 as you can buy.  That being said, there are a few nicks and blemishes, as seen in the pics below...most would have to be pointed out to you to notice.  Interior and Exterior are both a solid 9/10.

Everything functions as it should, no CEL, no other warning lights.  Plenty of life left on the brakes and tires.  No smoking, no pets, no kids.  No track time, no auto-x. 

Please do your own homework, but the IMS issue that plagued the M96 and early M97 engines is no longer a concern for the 2006 model year.  I'm sure I'll still get that question over and over, but at least I tried to cover it in the ad writeup!

Why am I selling?
I rarely drive it.  I carpool with two others to work, and a 911 doesn't work that well with a toddler.  On top of that, any free time and money I have left over after work/school/household stuff goes towards my SpecBoxster.  I'll own another 911 in the future, but having this car sit in the garage doesn't make sense for me right now.  

Logistics
I'm right in between Baltimore and Philadelphia, 10 minutes off I95.  I've helped with shipping before, and I've met people at the airport before.  I've also boarded planes to go buy cars, so I'm familiar with it from both ends.  Willing to help out to get the deal done.  

Clean MD title, clean CarFax

Asking $50k for one of the cleanest 997.1's on the market.  I believe the pricing is in line with the asks on other clean, low-mileage examples.

Please PM me for my contact info - happy to provide email and # for anyone interested.  

Thanks!
